and oftentimes they will fit into the build around Camp just like all Obi-Wan did so 4:40 we 'll keep our eye out for those and let us dive in as we do we like to rotate through which colors we start with just 4:46 you know to make sure that it 's fair to all the colors because we are human beings and maybe we get tired at the end or I do n't know we 're on black and uh 4:53 our first card up is called grafted butcher this is one in a black for a 2-2 4:58 forexian Samurai it 's a regular rare and when it enters the battlefield frexians you control gain Menace until end of 5:04 turn as we noted by the way Luis um just there 's more text here but there 's a lot of frexians in the set you know so 5:11 that 's definitely a relevant ability kind of interesting that it 's on a two drop right like you almost want to wait 5:16 and get that one big attack in later but let 's see what else it says it says other frexians you control get plus one 5:22 plus one wow so this thing 's really you know especially the turn it comes down a Powerhouse and you can pay three in a 5:30 black and sacrifice an artifact or creature to return grafted butcher from your graveyard to the battlefield at 5:37 sorcery speed dang so you actually can just run it out on turn two and let it do its thing and they 'll kill it at some 5:43 point and then you can bring it back and have some massive turn yeah the crafted butcher is excellent 5:49 It 's a lord for a creature type which there 's a lot of in the set it 's not as many asphlexia I 'll be one of course but 5:54 it 's a lot and then in addition it just keeps coming back if they kill it and it 6:00 even has an ETB so at some point you know they kill it you bring it back and you get some really good value out of it uh grafted butcher looks awesome this 6:07 looks like an a honestly like it 's good early it 's good late it 's not hard to draft around like I I would just say 6:14 this is an excellent card I would too I just did a quick search to see how many times uh forexian showed up on the card 6:21 it it this this is n't 100 like it counts ones that flip into aforexians and stuff so but there were 61 uh cards in the set 6:29 that have that on it I would assume that front side of it is probably in the 50 range but that 's a lot uh you know many 6:35 many cards it 's gon na be the most common creature type so I like a for grafted butcher as well I just love that you can 6:41 run it out there let it do its thing they 're gon na kill it at some point and you can set up for that turn where if you have like two or three on the 6:48 battlefield to turn you bring this back is nasty I mean they 're huge and they get Menace it 's going to be very 6:54 difficult the one downside right is that the effect only lasts as 7:00 long as grafted butcher is on the battlefield right so if they can kill it during combat you do have to be aware 7:07 that like your really great attack gets a lot worse if your grafted butcher leaves the Leafs play for any reason so 7:13 make sure that you factor that in on can I take this risk because taking away medicine plus one plus one can create 7:19 you know a potential game-winning situation into one where your creatures all die and you lose right so you do 7:25 have to be aware of it but we try not to harp too much on well what if it dies this is just a little more of a timing 7:31 thing where if you 're in combat counting on your grafted butcher to survive you should make sure that you uh do n't put 7:36 too many eggs in that basket um next up is uh 7:42 uh iara yeah ayara Widow of the realm this is one black black for a 3-3 legendary elf 7:50 Noble at rare and Ira looks like she has two activated abilities one of them is tap sacrifice 7:57 another creature or artifact and ayara Widow of the realm deals X damage to Target opponent or battle and you gain X 8:05 life where X is the sacrifice permanence Mana value okay and then you can pay five 8:11 anaphoraxian red to transform her at sorcery speed into iara furnace Queen 8:17 which is a 4-4 legendary forexian elf Noble this is at the beginning of combat 8:23 on your turn return up to one target artifact or creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield it gains 8:30 haste Exile it at the beginning of the next end step so this is an interesting flip card 8:36 because this is one of the first ones where it 's not obviously better to flip sometimes you 'll want to flip because a 8:42 4-4 that 's bringing something back every turn is very very good but I installed board sometimes you might want to just 8:48 keep the 3-3 ability to just start throwing your creatures at their face 8:53 basically right and uh both sides are strong as well uh obviously the combo kind of is you uh 9:01 play her sack a couple creatures then flip her and start bringing those creatures back but regardless of how you 9:06 want to do it IR is just a good card works really well in sacrifice text it 's just a good card overall this looks like 9:11 an A minus to me I think yes both sides are pretty threatening if your opponent casts this card at any point in the game 9:17 whether it 's turning three or turn 10 you 're going to be thinking okay how do I get rid of that yeah it 's just not a card that can stay in play that 's right 9:23 and you know there 's there 's the sequencing works out really well too because the flip side uh furnace Queen 9:29 does n't trigger until your combat step so you can come to your turn untap all your lands you know on say turn you know 9:36 six seven whatever sacrifice a creature to get in a big chunk that creature 's in the yard pay the transform cost flip it 9:43 over get that creature back jam with a 4-4 and whatever else you 've got and their life totals lower that 's going to 9:49 add up really fast and that 's just the most basic use case for the card right so it gets a lot worse over time as you 9:56 said Luis you do this two or three times and now you 've got this machine that 's bringing cards back it is worth noting 10:01 that once you transform it you ca n't sacrifice stuff anymore so like make sure your yard 's kind of where you want it two to three creatures would probably 10:08 be ideal I like a minus for Ira as well super powerful and interestingly I the first two cards 10:16 a deal with sacrifice and B you know make me want removal that Exiles you 10:21 know like there there is some good removal that Exiles but uh yeah it 's definitely gon na be at a premium here bloated processor is next this is two 10:29 and a black for a three two forexia and it 's rare it says sacrifice another forexian that 's the cost and you get to 10:36 put a plus one plus one counter on bloated processor and it says when it dies you incubate X where X is its power 10:44 so interesting it 's a free sacrifice uh but it has to be a farexian specifically 10:50 um but man I it 's hard to imagine arguing with just two in a black three two with that second ability 10:57 I mean two in the black three two that dies into incubate three is a card you 'd be really happy to put in your zipper 11:03 and then the fact that you can sack other frexians to save this in combat or from removal or just eventually buff the 11:09 incubate yeah I would also give this an A minus this is just a really effective card at pretty much any point in the game 11:16 yeah and you can sacrifice other incubated things to it right 11:21 because they 're also frexians uh their frexian when it flips so the 11:27 incubate is not practicing until you flip it but right it but it does you do have a lot of extra frexians lying 11:32 around as a result yes yeah so what did you want to give it I think a minus I mean your opponent cascus card you're 11:39 not really getting out of the exchange well and it can be a real threat when you have a couple other frexians in play yeah I was gon na go b-plus like this 11:47 seems like a solid two for one to me with a bit of upside with sacrificeability 11:53 I mean I guess you could just sacrifice a bunch of them and really make this thing something you know once it gets up 11:59 to you know six five or whatever it 's like not it 's like extremely threatening yeah I 12:05 have it right on that border B plus to a minus but the floor of just being a solid two for one is already in the deep 12:11 into the B range um next is invasion of innistrar this is our first uh battle at the rare and in 12:19 fact in this case Mythic rare slot so this is uh two black black for a five 12:25 defense battle with flash and it says when invasion of innistrad enters the 12:30 battlefield Target creature an opponent controls gets I love it when they do this minus 13 12:37 minus 13 until end of turn and then the other side of it so if you 12:42 can win the battle it becomes Deluge of the Dead which is an enchantment and when Deluge of the Dead enters the 12:48 battlefield to create two two black zombie creature tokens and you can pay 12:54 two in a black to Exile Target card from your graveyard if it was a creature card you get a 2-2 black zombie creature 13:01 token I also have to note here Luis one thing I always check for on this is whether they enter the battlefield tapped or not and none of them do no so 13:09 this is going to be one of the easiest battles to defeat because it 's got flash removes a blocker immediately and then 13:16 also uh lets you just line it up exactly the way you want it so you 're like end 13:22 of turn play this kill your only blocker immediately attack it yes and then and then as a result if you do if you're 13:27 able to do that you get two twos two two zombies so you 're not gon na die on the backswing most likely and then you can 13:34 start taking over the game with three men and make a zombie so fantastic card I mean it 's two black black kill Target 13:40 creature with lots of upside yes I do n't I had to be a broken record here but I think this card 's an a I do too I 13:47 do
