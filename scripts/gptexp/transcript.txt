[Applause] what is up everybody welcome to another episode of limited resources this is
0:18
episode number 695. my name is Marshall I'm one of your limited resources and joining me on the line all the way from
0:24
Denver Colorado it's Luis garvargas Luis did you say you're making a a ramp for
0:29
the jewels dog no so so the the way her dog door works
0:35
is it's that we had a company come out and drill a hole in the side of the the
0:40
house basically but just based on the way our backyard is and the living room
0:45
is there's like about I don't know six inches or so of a gap between the floor
0:51
and the start of the dog or on the outside and Jules is not a very big dog so we we
0:56
have a little ramp there we have one there it's like a thick rubber like it doesn't move but in the summer it gets
1:02
too hot like oh for her paws the ramp heats up so we we got uh a welcome mat
1:08
from from Ace and enter using that to cover the ramp very nice yeah Jewels
1:14
comes first over there no doubt about it but she's she's a great pup so
1:19
today Luis we've got our March of the machine set review rare and Mythic rare
1:24
so we're going to go over every single rare and Mythic rare in this set and also there's a bonus sheet that contains
1:30
uh extra cards that we're going to be going over here as well in fact some of those are technically uncommon but they appear in one slot per booster pack so
1:38
effectively like a rare and we're going to go over all of those as well super excited these are some of our favorite
1:43
shows to dive into what they came up with with these wild rares where they get a lot more leeway as far as design
1:49
goes first up we want to thank our uh supporters on patreon it's patreon.com
1:55
limited resources they are floating the ship here as we're searching around
2:00
for potential sponsorship opportunities uh we really did want to say thanks to everybody who supports us over there it
2:06
means a lot especially during times like this where we're kind of in flux as far as that goes um really really kind of you to uh to
2:13
support Luis and I and to keep LR going if you're interested in doing so it's uh once again it's patreon.com limited
2:19
resources and you'll get a thank you card and a limited resources sticker in the mail for signing up at any level and
2:25
you get access to some pretty cool stuff so again thanks to everybody for supporting us over there we do
2:30
appreciate it Luis we're going to be using um our grading scale here for the rares and Mythic rares the same one that
2:36
we used on our last show yeah so uh there's a through F grading
2:41
scale with two sub grades A's are bombs game winners just the best cards in the set and you'll see a lot of them here in
2:49
the rare show we're talking cards like Nissa or miglas these are cars that actively pull you towards their color so
2:55
these are the cards that you're very happy to play you're happy to take early and they pull you toward whatever color
3:00
or combination of colors they are we're talking cards like Cinder slash ravager Rebel solvo
3:06
C's are playable these are the Pawns of limited they're pretty interchangeable you're not thrilled or unhappy they're
3:12
just cards that go in your deck rares typically don't fall into this category all that often of course some will we're
3:17
talking cards like volt charge or blight belly rat just you know very reasonable cards these are cards that are sometimes
3:24
playable but you really would prefer not to run them they're just not that good and uh kind of mediocre junky cards a
3:30
little too expensive a little too slow a little too weak cards like cruel grimnark uh sending you dancer called
3:35
with a cackler F's are cards that are unplayable in virtually all scenarios so rares actually get quite a bit more of
3:42
those than than the average and uh we're talking cards like mind splice apparatus
3:48
so you'll see some rares that are just like this card cost 10 Mana you know or you're obviously not putting this card in your deck the two subgrades we have
3:54
sideboard so these are cards that rarely if ever make the main deck but can be very powerful out of the sideboard we're
4:00
talking cards like duress or minor misstep and uh they'll get a grade corresponding to that but again there
4:06
are cars that you typically don't main deck and then build around a lot of rares fall into this category these are
4:11
cards that by themselves don't do quite enough but can be very good when you've built around them when you've put enough
4:16
of the right cards that work with them they can be some of the best cards in your entire deck so uh we're talking about cards like all will be one from
4:23
frexia where if you built around it fantastic card if you didn't didn't end up doing a whole lot yeah and and as you
4:30
mentioned uh rarest and Mythic rares tend to be more polarized right like they could be really great but sometimes
4:35
they can be really terrible and oftentimes they will fit into the build around Camp just like all Obi-Wan did so
4:40
we'll keep our eye out for those and let us dive in as we do we like to rotate through which colors we start with just
4:46
you know to make sure that it's fair to all the colors because we are human beings and maybe we get tired at the end or I don't know we're on black and uh
4:53
our first card up is called grafted butcher this is one in a black for a 2-2
4:58
forexian Samurai it's a regular rare and when it enters the battlefield frexians you control gain Menace until end of
5:04
turn as we noted by the way Luis um just there's more text here but there's a lot of frexians in the set you know so
5:11
that's definitely a relevant ability kind of interesting that it's on a two drop right like you almost want to wait
5:16
and get that one big attack in later but let's see what else it says it says other frexians you control get plus one
5:22
plus one wow so this thing's really you know especially the turn it comes down a Powerhouse and you can pay three in a
5:30
black and sacrifice an artifact or creature to return grafted butcher from your graveyard to the battlefield at
5:37
sorcery speed dang so you actually can just run it out on turn two and let it do its thing and they'll kill it at some
5:43
point and then you can bring it back and have some massive turn yeah the crafted butcher is excellent
5:49
It's a lord for a creature type which there's a lot of in the set it's not as many asphlexia I'll be one of course but
5:54
it's a lot and then in addition it just keeps coming back if they kill it and it
6:00
even has an ETB so at some point you know they kill it you bring it back and you get some really good value out of it uh grafted butcher looks awesome this
6:07
looks like an a honestly like it's good early it's good late it's not hard to draft around like I I would just say
6:14
this is an excellent card I would too I just did a quick search to see how many times uh forexian showed up on the card
6:21
it it this this isn't 100 like it counts ones that flip into aforexians and stuff so but there were 61 uh cards in the set
6:29
that have that on it I would assume that front side of it is probably in the 50 range but that's a lot uh you know many
6:35
many cards it's gonna be the most common creature type so I like a for grafted butcher as well I just love that you can
6:41
run it out there let it do its thing they're gonna kill it at some point and you can set up for that turn where if you have like two or three on the
6:48
battlefield to turn you bring this back is nasty I mean they're huge and they get Menace it's going to be very
6:54
difficult the one downside right is that the effect only lasts as
7:00
long as grafted butcher is on the battlefield right so if they can kill it during combat you do have to be aware
7:07
that like your really great attack gets a lot worse if your grafted butcher leaves the Leafs play for any reason so
7:13
make sure that you factor that in on can I take this risk because taking away medicine plus one plus one can create
7:19
you know a potential game-winning situation into one where your creatures all die and you lose right so you do
7:25
have to be aware of it but we try not to harp too much on well what if it dies this is just a little more of a timing
7:31
thing where if you're in combat counting on your grafted butcher to survive you should make sure that you uh don't put
7:36
too many eggs in that basket um next up is uh
7:42
uh iara yeah ayara Widow of the realm this is one black black for a 3-3 legendary elf
7:50
Noble at rare and Ira looks like she has two activated abilities one of them is tap sacrifice
7:57
another creature or artifact and ayara Widow of the realm deals X damage to Target opponent or battle and you gain X
8:05
life where X is the sacrifice permanence Mana value okay and then you can pay five
8:11
anaphoraxian red to transform her at sorcery speed into iara furnace Queen
8:17
which is a 4-4 legendary forexian elf Noble this is at the beginning of combat
8:23
on your turn return up to one target artifact or creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield it gains
8:30
haste Exile it at the beginning of the next end step so this is an interesting flip card
8:36
because this is one of the first ones where it's not obviously better to flip sometimes you'll want to flip because a
8:42
4-4 that's bringing something back every turn is very very good but I installed board sometimes you might want to just
8:48
keep the 3-3 ability to just start throwing your creatures at their face
8:53
basically right and uh both sides are strong as well uh obviously the combo kind of is you uh
9:01
play her sack a couple creatures then flip her and start bringing those creatures back but regardless of how you
9:06
want to do it IR is just a good card works really well in sacrifice text it's just a good card overall this looks like
9:11
an A minus to me I think yes both sides are pretty threatening if your opponent casts this card at any point in the game
9:17
whether it's turning three or turn 10 you're going to be thinking okay how do I get rid of that yeah it's just not a card that can stay in play that's right
9:23
and you know there's there's the sequencing works out really well too because the flip side uh furnace Queen
9:29
doesn't trigger until your combat step so you can come to your turn untap all your lands you know on say turn you know
9:36
six seven whatever sacrifice a creature to get in a big chunk that creature's in the yard pay the transform cost flip it
9:43
over get that creature back jam with a 4-4 and whatever else you've got and their life totals lower that's going to
9:49
add up really fast and that's just the most basic use case for the card right so it gets a lot worse over time as you
9:56
said Luis you do this two or three times and now you've got this machine that's bringing cards back it is worth noting
10:01
that once you transform it you can't sacrifice stuff anymore so like make sure your yard's kind of where you want it two to three creatures would probably
10:08
be ideal I like a minus for Ira as well super powerful and interestingly I the first two cards
10:16
a deal with sacrifice and B you know make me want removal that Exiles you
10:21
know like there there is some good removal that Exiles but uh yeah it's definitely gonna be at a premium here bloated processor is next this is two
10:29
and a black for a three two forexia and it's rare it says sacrifice another forexian that's the cost and you get to
10:36
put a plus one plus one counter on bloated processor and it says when it dies you incubate X where X is its power
10:44
so interesting it's a free sacrifice uh but it has to be a farexian specifically
10:50
um but man I it's hard to imagine arguing with just two in a black three two with that second ability
10:57
I mean two in the black three two that dies into incubate three is a card you'd be really happy to put in your zipper
11:03
and then the fact that you can sack other frexians to save this in combat or from removal or just eventually buff the
11:09
incubate yeah I would also give this an A minus this is just a really effective card at pretty much any point in the game
11:16
yeah and you can sacrifice other incubated things to it right
11:21
because they're also frexians uh their frexian when it flips so the
11:27
incubate is not practicing until you flip it but right it but it does you do have a lot of extra frexians lying
11:32
around as a result yes yeah so what did you want to give it I think a minus I mean your opponent cascus card you're
11:39
not really getting out of the exchange well and it can be a real threat when you have a couple other frexians in play yeah I was gonna go b-plus like this
11:47
seems like a solid two for one to me with a bit of upside with sacrificeability
11:53
I mean I guess you could just sacrifice a bunch of them and really make this thing something you know once it gets up
11:59
to you know six five or whatever it's like not it's like extremely threatening yeah I
12:05
have it right on that border B plus to a minus but the floor of just being a solid two for one is already in the deep
12:11
into the B range um next is invasion of innistrar this is our first uh battle at the rare and in
12:19
fact in this case Mythic rare slot so this is uh two black black for a five
12:25
defense battle with flash and it says when invasion of innistrad enters the
12:30
battlefield Target creature an opponent controls gets I love it when they do this minus 13
12:37
minus 13 until end of turn and then the other side of it so if you
12:42
can win the battle it becomes Deluge of the Dead which is an enchantment and when Deluge of the Dead enters the
12:48
battlefield to create two two black zombie creature tokens and you can pay
12:54
two in a black to Exile Target card from your graveyard if it was a creature card you get a 2-2 black zombie creature
13:01
token I also have to note here Luis one thing I always check for on this is whether they enter the battlefield tapped or not and none of them do no so
13:09
this is going to be one of the easiest battles to defeat because it's got flash removes a blocker immediately and then
13:16
also uh lets you just line it up exactly the way you want it so you're like end
13:22
of turn play this kill your only blocker immediately attack it yes and then and then as a result if you do if you're
13:27
able to do that you get two twos two two zombies so you're not gonna die on the backswing most likely and then you can
13:34
start taking over the game with three men and make a zombie so fantastic card I mean it's two black black kill Target
13:40
creature with lots of upside yes I don't I had to be a broken record here but I think this card's an a I do too I
13:47
do too I just think it's gonna be really good like compare it to four Mana make two two twos kill a creature yes it's
13:53
not that hard to imagine doing that that car would be absurd that's right and and you know the play pattern for this works
13:59
out well so you lined up that early part of it but there's the other part where you can actually commit attack to get an
14:05
attack to get this thing transformed and then you have two Tutus sitting there at the minimum right you may have Mana up
14:12
to make more of them meaning that even if you are in a racing situation your opponent attacks you with a bunch of
14:18
stuff you flash Us in kill one of their attackers and you can afford to attack the battle here and not have to leave
14:23
everything back because once you get it transformed you have a board state to protect your life total uh already so it
14:30
plays beautifully um I like a for invasion of innistrub next is pile on this is three in a black
14:37
for an instant at rare it has convoke and it says destroy Target creature or Planeswalker and sir Veil 2.
14:46
the solid piece of removal here it's just super efficient it's an instant it kills anything
14:51
you get surveill to which is not quite draw a card but it's you know closer to that than it is to not drawing a card
14:57
and then convoke of course is excellent I mean this is about as premium as
15:03
removal can get yeah let's say a minus for pylon I agree for efficiency really
15:08
a solid card yeah I mean you could pay one or zero or two Mana for this effect that's just insane
15:13
um next is Arch priest Arc priest of Shadows which is three black black for a four four human warlock at rare it's got
15:21
backup one and it has death touch but it has another ability because remember
15:26
backup says it gains the following abilities until end of turn so it gains anything after that so it gets death
15:32
touch and it also gets whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player or battle return Target creature card
15:39
from your graveyard to the battlefield the way this plays is you cast Arch
15:44
priest and either you give your worst creature the counter so then you attack with your now 2-2 death touch and they
15:51
have to block it and trade something for it or you get a creature back or you give a good creature that ability
15:57
and then they have to like double block it or drop it or you give an evasive creature of the ability to immediately
16:02
Spike and you're left with a 4-4 death touch that if it ever hits them brings creature back black just has all bangers
16:07
I mean this is another a like you can't say otherwise no and of course if you
16:12
have a flyer right if you have an unblockable if you have something that could just get in that turn regardless and you can set that up then you can
16:19
just do that get your creature back and and you've got a full board State going wow that's a great card uh next
16:28
I guess she's she's gotten famous enough now just to be a one name Superstar children yep children there's no nothing
16:36
else she's just there it's her and she's a three black black for a four five
16:41
legendary forexian predator and as you might guess this is a Mythic she's got Menace and when she enters the
16:49
battlefield each opponent sacrifices a non-token creature or planeswalker
16:54
you know they're pushing this right if they're like hey we're just going to call this card shieldridge you know and it's going to cost five Mana this is
17:00
gonna be absolutely nuts and so far it already is but wait there's more you can
17:05
pay four in a black to Exile shielded then return it to the battlefield transformed under its owner's control
17:10
activate only as a sorcery and only if an opponent has eight or more cards in
17:15
their graveyard so what does shieldra become upon re-entering the battlefield the true scriptures which is a saga an
17:24
enchantment Saga and it says as this as always as The Saga enters the as it as
17:30
it enters the battlefield in after your draw step add a lore counter chapter one is for each opponent destroy up to one
17:37
target creature or Planeswalker that player control so you're getting that straight away chapter 2 is each opponent discards
17:44
three cards and then Mills three cards and chapter three is put all creature
17:50
cards from all graveyards onto the battlefield under your control Exile the true scriptures then return it to the
17:57
battlefield front face up are you kidding me
18:02
this is just ludicrous look at the straight children is five Mana for a four or five minutes that
18:08
edicts your opponent yes so that's that's the that's the thing of things a probably a menace four or five that
18:15
edicts is like already into the a range and then if they have eight or more
18:21
cards in your deck and maybe they're tapped out or you have the time to do it you pay five Mana you flip shieldred you
18:27
you immediately kill their best creature then you make them discard three cards and Mill three cards and then you bring
18:32
all creatures back and you get children back and you get the ETB of children
18:38
so it's and does that sound like a merry-go-round that you want to partake
18:44
in I mean we yeah she's back again you know come on so yeah I mean children's
18:49
in a plus like every part of this is fantastic uh unbelievable card uh again
18:55
when I saw sheildred with no other text and Mythic rare I'm like all right buckle up next card
19:01
um is invasion of Fiora which as you might imagine is a battle this is a four black black
19:08
four uh defense battle and it says when invasion of Fiora enters the battlefield
19:14
choose one or both destroy all legendary creatures and or
19:21
destroy all non-legendary creatures so you can't choose to just have it be a
19:27
Wrath and then uh it flips into marchesa
19:32
Resolute Monarch which is a legendary human Noble that's a three six with
19:39
Menace and death touch and whenever it attacks remove all counters from up to
19:45
one target permanent and at the beginning of your upkeep if you haven't been dealt combat damage
19:51
since your last turn you draw a card and lose one life boy they just have no chill with these
19:58
things man no so this is a mostly a six Mana wrath but of course you get to to choose kind of what you want to do past
20:06
that um and then if you do manage to take it down with four defense it's not impossible to do so you can you can go
20:13
ahead and uh get a 3 6 that has a bunch of abilities but what I find interesting
20:19
about this card is if you ever can rack up a legendary creature you can play this kill all non-legendary creatures
20:24
and immediately attack it with your legendary creature that's a great setup and you know obviously they can't have a
20:30
legendary creature for that torque too and it's not it doesn't seem like it's that impossible to do but also just six
20:36
minute Kill All Creatures leave behind good value that your opponent has still has to worry about it look the thing
20:42
with all these battles are we don't think they're easy to flip we don't think it's free it's very very much not
20:48
right but but with something like invasion of Fiora I would play this without the back side yes it's a six
20:54
Mana Kill All Creatures card that has even a little bit of flexibility if you happen to have a legend or somehow they have a legend and you don't have a
21:00
legend right right and then you get this sub game where if you can ever attack unblocked you you
21:07
have the chance to get a really good amount of value huge amount and then on something with something like invasion
21:12
of industrade that has Flash and kills a creature obviously it's very different that that you can pretty pretty easily set up the whole thing yeah but overall
21:19
I mean this card I think is an A minus it's not a full a just because it's still a six Mana wrath and it's not
21:26
necessarily gonna do a ton more than that but the card definitely has a lot of good stuff going for it definitely
21:31
and you know because I've been thinking about the battles into two kind of subgroups right one of them is
21:38
if I if I commit a full attack to the battle to get it transformed maybe I
21:44
have to give up a creature to do it or at least leave my Shields down fully for a turn what is it return to me when my
21:50
opponent is looking at the attack on the other side right do I have a board state of some sort does it become a creature
21:56
that can block does it become something that blows up a creature on the other side or does it get me non-board value
22:02
like does it you know generate me you know some cards or whatever but the shields are very much down those are the
22:08
two kind of groups that you have to think about because you always have to recognize that in many cases you're going to have to attack with your best
22:14
creatures to get them transformed this one has a play pattern that as you pointed out is so different from the
22:20
like we saw invasion of innistrad which is the most obvious play pattern this one is different like if you blow up the whole board they the battle is just
22:26
sitting there and you have to like reload and eventually be able to attack it unless you set up the thing and that
22:32
does make it a bit weaker but I agree with you I mean the power ceiling on this is very high rafts are generally
22:37
quite good um six Mana rats are generally not so good but this one can become I mean the
22:43
creature it becomes them are Chaser is insane that's a nasty really nasty card
22:48
especially if you can get it transformed in any type of time frame because you'll start generating that card Advantage
22:54
right away um next is breach the Multiverse it's five black black for a sorcery at rare
23:03
this better be good right I mean we've already given away a ton of A's here in Black this is the seven manual Black's
23:08
got an unbroken streak actually every card has been an A minus or better
23:14
oh my God you're right and there was even an A plus in children and honestly I think art priest of
23:20
Shadows is pretty close to an A plus like it it does a lot of work so what does reach the Multiverse do well yeah
23:26
just five black black like you said sorcery sorcery and it starts with each player Mills 10
23:32
cards so it's like okay we've got a weird one yeah but then for each player choose a creature or Planeswalker and
23:38
that player's graveyard so it doesn't have to be among those 10 milled but of course Millington sweetens the pot and
23:44
then each and then put those cards onto the battlefield under your control and all your creatures become fractions in
23:50
addition to their types so wow it's a seven minute spell but you're gonna get to put the best creature in each
23:55
graveyard into play under your control or Planeswalker if you're lucky this is another a like this is the kind of card
24:00
where if you build a you know black white kind of deck that can stall out maybe gain
24:06
some life and then you just cast this on turn seven you're gonna end up with the two best creatures in play like that's
24:12
really that's really strong and out of a huge sample because it's 10 plus this is
24:17
a seven drop let's be conservative and say there's four cards in the graveyard there could easily be nine but let's say
24:24
there's four you're choosing from 14 cards right I mean you know you're
24:29
uh you know coming up on a third or you're a bit over a third of your opponent's library in your library to
24:36
pick the best card out of each of those like that's great you're gonna find some really good you're not bricking right
24:41
you're never gonna miss on this ever it's pretty hard to you're right I mean it would be almost impossible to just
24:46
outright Miss unless somebody built a creatureless deck but if it's anything normal you're gonna hit something which
24:52
of course is kind of the the bottom but I mean you're also going to hit good stuff a decent chunk of the time
24:58
I do like giving this a build around grade I mean you you do have to go you do have to have a deck that's designed
25:05
to go along but once you hit seven you just get such a great board State out of it one other thing Louise that I have to
25:11
note here is that like do you think that each player Milling 10 cards could become a strategic like if the game is
25:18
very late you Mill both players out and say go you win also I mean Blue Block does have a bit
25:25
of the uh Mill them to eight strategy so there's a couple other cards that just kind of
25:31
randomly Mill your opponents too to get their grand yard up to eight cards yeah yeah so but imagine if you put this in
25:37
like a blue black deck sometimes you've milled them for six cards and then the game kind of goes long
25:43
another 10 cards on top of that is all of a sudden that's just it right so it's got that I mean there is the
25:50
slight drawback of if you're going through your deck quick more fast more quickly than your opponent you end up
25:57
looking at this minute oh am I going to Mill myself out but that's not something I think is going to happen very often
26:02
agreed and then there of course just will be those games where it's two control decks going at it and nobody's
26:08
really able to get anything going and this will end the game in your favor like if you're both below 10 cards then
26:14
you win I like build around a for breach the Multiverse I do feel like you would put
26:20
it into any deck that could reasonably cast it but you're this is a seven Mana card like you you do need to make sure
26:26
you can get up to seven and if this format ends up being fast at all that could be a lot to ask
26:32
yeah I I I wouldn't call this a builder on I would just give it an a like it's a seven minute card inherent in seven Mana
26:39
cards are are what you're describing okay I don't know if you want to call those build arounds or not I mean I don't know I just want to note that you
26:44
do you know this is not just gonna play this without a little bit of help you
26:50
know especially if you're like I'm gonna play 16 lands or whatever right but I think that it's pretty easy to imagine
26:55
building a deck that just goes a little longer and tries to cast this card because it's a fantastic card if you do cast it agreed all right hoarding brood
27:04
Lord can you keep the streak alive it is five black black
27:09
I gotta tell you Luis I it almost doesn't matter what it says after this like that's gonna be really tough to
27:15
give an A2 just a card that costs eight Mana with triple black spoiler the next word is gonna help and it's getting an A
27:20
okay it's a dragon it's a 7-6 with flying it's a rare and it has convoke so
27:29
they tricked me that eight Mana is not eight Mana in fact it's probably significantly less so what does it do
27:35
when hoarding brood Lord enters the battlefield search your library for a card Exile it face down then shuffle for
27:43
as long as that card remains exiled you may play it and spells you cast from
27:48
Exile have convoke you can and you get to pick the card
27:53
oh yeah so it's you play this it it's demonic tutor
27:59
uh you know you get the best card out of your deck and that card even gets convoked and 76 flyer that you can tap
28:07
two or three creatures to cast at a reasonable cost that's incredible and the cards even exiled so they can't take
28:13
it out of your hand like not that that really happens and limited that much but it's like in a safe spot and it doesn't
28:20
care what happens to the hoarding brood Lord either like if it dies immediately you can still just cast that other card
28:25
to the next turn yep this is a regular rare
28:31
yeah I mean this card this card oh my God black just went end to end yep both
28:37
sides of the Court we're just straight up 10 10A level rares right off the bat just Coast to Coast for black wow the
28:43
good thing is this never happened right shieldred aside these cards don't seem completely outrageous so yeah there's a
28:50
lot of gameplay to them but it does mean that you know there's a lot of people can open up a black rare and just be like all right yeah I guess this is
28:55
where I'm going definitely also of note is sealed this type of thing tends to
29:01
affect sealed where it's like oh you open a black rear you're good to go wow incredible so a for hoarding brood
29:07
Lord that's gonna bring us to red let's see if we can keep up uh first red
29:12
card is called blood feather Phoenix it is one in a red for a 2-2 Phoenix at
29:18
rare it has flying and it can't block so you get a 2-2 flyer for two which is
29:23
insane but it cannot block so less good it says whenever an instant or sorcery spell you control
29:30
and yes you do control spells while they're on the stack deals damage to an opponent or battle
29:36
you may pay red if you do return bloodfeather Phoenix from your graveyard
29:42
to the battlefield it gains haste and tone of turn yeah that's really good solid Edition
29:48
any any red deck most of the time that you spend a card
29:53
to deal damage to your opponent you're you're kind of down a card but this makes it makes it you know kind of makes
30:00
it up it just kind of gives you those cards as an option to uh you kind of get get to use those cards as a way to bring
30:06
this back even if you don't care about the damage all that much but uh I mean the 2-2 flyer is exactly what red decks
30:13
want even if it can't block I'll give this a B I think this is good for an aggressive red deck super solid B for blood feather Phoenix next is invasion
30:20
of tarkir this is one in a red for a Mythic rare battle it has five defense
30:26
and it says when invasion of tarkir enters a battlefield reveal any number of Dragon cards from your hand
30:33
when you do invasion of tarkir deals X plus two damage to any Target where X is
30:40
the number of cards revealed this way so it you know that first sentence sucks
30:46
where you're like dragons like how many of those am I going to have unlimited but it does two right so we have a
30:51
sorcery speed two damage minimum and if you can flip it and remember it
30:56
is five defense so it's quite a bit it becomes defiant thunderma which is a
31:02
4-4 flying trampoline dragon that says whenever a dragon you control attacks it
31:09
deals two damage to any Target dang and it is I mean I want to go back to this again but this uh battle is two
31:17
Mana so you get it down early this reminds me a lot of Bone Crusher giant you're spending two Mana early to kill
31:23
something to deal two at sorcery speed obviously if you have a dragon randomly it's pretty nice but that's you know
31:28
that's not going to happen too often but then if you ever can defeat the battle you get this 4-4 flying trample
31:34
that deals two when it attacks I mean that card's great too totally and you have a long time to plan out how you
31:41
want to go about this right I mean you if you play this on turn two and kill their two drop then you can really say
31:47
all right you know I'm gonna play the mini game here and I'm gonna try to get this thing transformed because this Dragon will take over the game
31:53
oh he's and and I think that again we haven't seen how it plays out
31:58
but if my opponent plays this to kill my teardrop I'm just like thinking I'm just like sighing because in in my head I'm
32:04
thinking the whole rest of the game I have to deal with the fact that this isn't playing I really don't want them to flip it yeah
32:11
um what grade would you give one in a red sorcery deal two damage
32:17
two is it any Target I forget actually uh I think so two damage to any other
32:24
Target yeah you can't hit itself okay but yeah for what would you what is is
32:29
that a c plus is it is it does does that get into the B range if it's just two
32:34
Mana sorcery one in a red deal two damage to any Target
32:40
s right like a plus yeah so you get that but then you
32:46
just get this tremendous opportunity for a game-winning bomb if you can dedicate the resources to get this thing
32:51
transformed how much does that pump the grade up because it is five like to me
32:56
if I'm a red aggressive deck I have to make a choice right am I gonna actually try to dedicate resources to getting
33:03
this thing transformed at the cost of multiple attack steps plus five damage
33:08
that could have gone to my opponent or am I gonna say that was fun you're the dragon's gonna stay in the egg and I'm
33:14
just gonna keep bashing my opponent here yeah I mean
33:20
I think that if I thought I had a pretty good chance of of hitting this I would go for it I think so too but what how
33:28
much higher does the grade make it to have the opportunity to do so like is this amount higher I think it's a B plus
33:34
yeah that's that's kind of where I'm at I'm just trying to think of like how I would feel if they played this on turn two and I feel I would feel like they
33:41
got a pretty significant Advantage I think so too I think the way I would feel about it okay B plus for invasion
33:47
of tarkir and and as Louise said if you do happen to have another Dragon it gets kind of like that's really good now two
33:53
Mana for three damage next is Into the Fire it's two in a red for a sorcery at rare it says choose one end of the fire
34:00
deals two damage to each creature Planeswalker and battle and the other is put any number of cards
34:07
from your hand onto the bottom of your library then draw that many cards plus one
34:13
wow so this is a sorcery for three that does two very different things
34:20
it's basically looking to be pretty flexible yeah neither side is all that impressive
34:27
yeah I agree I'm not I'm not super very situational three Mana in red deal deal
34:32
two to everything and paying three minutes to recycle like you know discard your two worst cards
34:37
draw three cards is just fine this looks more like a constructed card to me than like one that I'm super stoked about
34:42
limited it's probably worth playing just because it lets you cash it out pretty nicely and it's a powerful effect in the
34:48
right game yeah it's a lot of Mana though it's three Mana like
34:53
like that that turn that you do the put any number of cards onto the bottom of your library thing is kind of your whole
34:59
turn in most cases that's a lot I do have to note here though that like this thing hit hits battles and we have
35:06
to remember that we did note in the uh Commons and uncommons review about particularly green Red's ability to get
35:12
it battles and that does remind me for invasion of tarkir that like if it is in that deck then it's even easier to
35:19
transform so yeah you play your 4-4 and attack it and as a five five or whatever right so something to keep in mind I I
35:25
I'm with you like I would put into the fire at sideboard at best because you know you can bring it in against small
35:32
creature deck or something but I'm not that impressed by it it's this is sometimes cards Elevate themselves by
35:39
having two non-amazing abilities but they combine via versatility to be worth
35:45
it and this one feels like it's a little short like it is not that hard to imagine a scenario where neither ability is really
35:51
desirable yeah the the only one it's going to be that has the potential
35:57
to be really good is the deal too because sometimes your opponent plays three creatures into it the other one is just like
36:03
I'm playing this because I have nothing better to do how often do you want to spend three mana and not go up in cards not go up in board presence right right
36:10
so almost never um yeah I think another way to think of these types of cards that have two very
36:15
disparate abilities is that you would prefer them to be on the same Continuum right like these are these are two
36:22
totally different things it's not like you say well I either need to use this to blow up creatures or I want to recycle all the cards in my hand it's
36:28
like what no those are those are not the same axes and I think that that hurts this card as well so I would give into
36:34
the fire like probably like a sideboard C something like that you know it's it's really not
36:40
that great uh what does nahiri's warcrafting do it's one red red for a sorcery rare and
36:47
here's Warcraft and Deals five damage to Target creature Planeswalker or battle so hits anything except players
36:55
look at the top X cards in your library where X is the excess damage dealt this way you may Exile one of these cards put
37:01
the rest on the bottom you may play the excelled card this turn so basically it's three minutes for a dl5
37:07
sorcery with double red which that's good you're happy with that and then when you target something that has less
37:13
than five toughness you get to PL to Exile that many cards and play one this
37:19
turn so you can play land off it because it says play not cast but it has to be this turn it's not until the end of your
37:25
next turn so you're not going to want to play this on turn three but in the late game you know you hit like a good three
37:31
toughness creature you get to play one of your top two cards all you have to do is hit something with four toughness or
37:37
less and you'll get at least one card out of it if you hit something with five toughness it's just straight up deal five right but I mean hitting hitting
37:45
something small and then and then getting uh getting a kind of good look at the next
37:51
couple cards it's pretty solid two for one I would say it is I also like that it hits battle specifically because we
37:57
have seen I we haven't seen a battle that has more than five defense right yeah there's I think there's one with
38:03
six but okay I think that's like maybe the heaviest one most of the battles are not are not like an insane amount of
38:09
toughness right most of them are four some of them are five that means that you know if you are looking to flip
38:14
battles this does it and maybe even gets you a card yeah and again I'd be happy playing this
38:20
card at one red red sorcery deal five to any Target is fine so and give new here's warcrafting probably a B plus C
38:26
plus that's where I'm at too it doesn't quite hit a but I mean it has the potential for a two for one and it kills
38:32
most things for only three Mana that's quite that's quite good if it did the newer templating where it let you play
38:37
the card until the end of your next turn then we would be into a range because that would be a uh pretty almost always
38:43
reliable two for one yeah um next is voldarin thrill seeker this
38:48
is two in a red for a vampire Warrior at rare it's just a one one
38:54
but it has backup two so you get the two plus one plus one counters and the
38:59
ability is one sacrifice this creature it deals damage equal to its power to
39:05
any Target who's seeking the Thrills here you know
39:10
I mean I think the joke here is you play this you put two plus one plus one counters on your six six and you just
39:16
nug your opponent for eight totally yeah you attack with it right yeah and then
39:22
and then Chuck it at their face I mean even if you don't end up sacrificing the
39:28
other creature this is at very worst three Mana for a three three that you can pay one to sack it to deal three
39:34
he's getting to put the counter somewhere else is still very good I mean you play this you put two counters on your 2-2 flyer now it's a 4-4 flyer and
39:40
then you have a one one that lets you sack itself to deal one I don't really have a problem with that either yeah no
39:47
this is all good stuff just you know honestly if this card just
39:52
read two in a red one one back up two I would already be like that's very good
39:58
right like putting two plus one plus one counters on a card is already just very powerful and leaving behind even an
40:04
Expendable body that you can sacrifice or do that's all fine like that would be into the B range for me the fact that it
40:11
can have this game ending effect or this removal spell-esque thing only adds to it I would give it a B plus like to me
40:19
that's type of card that when you play it out you're gonna go oh yeah this is great
40:24
yeah I like B plus purple door and thrill seeker all right invasion of call Heim is next it's three and a red uh for
40:31
a four defense battle and it says when invasion of call time enter is the battlefield Exile all cards from your
40:38
hand then draw that many cards until the end of your next turn you may play cards
40:44
exiled this way foreign so the cards that were in your hand go
40:50
away but then you can play them until the end of your next turn and then they're replaced by actual cards
40:56
interesting transforms into pyre of the world tree which is an enchantment that says discard a land card power of the
41:03
world tree deals two damage to any Target and whenever you discard a land card Exile the top card of your library
41:10
you may play that card this turn this is incredible the design on this is
41:16
really great right because you just know you're gonna be like I'm gonna ditch my whole hand I'm not gonna be able to play
41:21
all the cards and then I'm going to get stuck with a bunch of lands it's like no problem
41:27
that's kind of exactly what you want here right because this feels like landfall where it's like you you get the
41:32
best either way yeah no this is pretty cool the the in terms of how it plays
41:38
out I don't think it's that good because it's a four Mana spell that doesn't
41:43
really it doesn't add to the board at all and uh yeah it kind of doubles the
41:48
number of cards in hand but you also can't really be if you have a ton of cards in your hand it means you weren't doing that much and then playing another
41:54
card like this still doesn't help you do that much so I'm I'm kind of medium on this one
42:00
this it just seems it just seems okay the the upside is insane right like if
42:07
you can flip it look this is one of those battles where if you can flip it I think it it's just awesome yeah but it
42:14
doesn't add at all to the board and it's for Mana like I don't know how easy it is to do that you know very difficult
42:19
yeah I I think you would almost want this in the red green battle flipping deck
42:25
you know that has creatures and effects that are almost like temporarily great at flipping battles but then kind of go
42:31
away yeah if you are building a deck to to to
42:37
work with this I think it can be good this looks like this looks like a b to me like a build around B build around B
42:45
where if you're if you're putting in the work then in invasion of call time can be really strong but in a lot of cases
42:52
you're you're just not going to want to include this card like in your red blue deck for example yeah I agree
42:58
finicky but extremely high upside uh next one is uh another uh battle it's
43:04
called invasion of karsis it is two red red for a four defense battle it says
43:09
when it enters the battlefield it deals three damage to each creature and each planeswalker
43:16
and then it transforms into refraction Elemental which is a 4-4 creature it's
43:23
an elemental and it has Ward pay to life and it says whenever you cast a spell refraction Elemental deals too damage to
43:30
each opponent and that's any spell by the way that counts creatures anything
43:36
huh so are you supposed to build around this so that it doesn't kill a bunch of your
43:42
stuff or what's what's the joke here I think what you're trying to do with invasion of
43:48
karsis is either have four toughness creatures or just use this as a way to like sweep the
43:53
whole board and then when and when you do that you ideally you have a four four
43:59
you kill everything you attack and flip it obviously that's gonna that would be great if you could do that right but even if just a three-dimens spell tends
44:06
to sweep boards pretty quickly and pretty effectively so I think what a lot of times is going to happen is you're
44:11
gonna play this kill everything and then it's kind of like the the the battle uh that
44:18
we talked about before uh invasion of Fiora where you kind of Wrath and now you have this 4-4 battle or four four
44:24
toughness battle sitting there and it's just not not easy for your opponent to always defend it you they have to do
44:30
something that makes sense I mean the play pattern seems obvious with this
44:36
it does hinge on it coming down on turn four probably most of the time
44:41
yeah I I feel like a little less than invasion of Fiora because
44:47
red tends to want sweepers a little less than black and this is not an unconditional sweeper which Cuts both
44:52
ways yeah it's obviously good if you like turn three you play a two four and then turn four you play this right but
44:58
in a lot of the cases I think you're going to end up treating this mostly as a sweeper I
45:03
think it's going to be okay invasion of course this looks like a b to me it doesn't work it doesn't look crazy I think so too I think the big caveat is
45:10
if you're trying to be like a low to the ground red aggressive deck this loses a ton of steam because it's just going to
45:15
kill so many of your own guys uh next is rampaging Raptor this is two red red for a 4-4 dinosaur it's rare it
45:23
has trample and haste and you can pay two in a red to give it plus two plus zero and talent of turn wow this thing's
45:30
nasty and when it deals combat damage to an opponent it deals that much damage to Target Planeswalker that player controls
45:37
or battle that player protects damn this is the requesting Beast I mean
45:44
four Mana four four trample haste and you can spend Mana to pump it up if you end up in a spot where that's good is
45:50
awesome and the fact that it just Snipes Planeswalkers or battles is even better I give her a paging Raptor an a I would
45:57
too sometimes you're just going to play this on turn four your opponent's gonna take four off the bat and they're gonna look
46:02
at their hand and be like I guess the best I can do is block it with a three three and a 2-2 and you'll pump it and and get to deal uh you know
46:10
an extra point of damage on top of that yeah and that's what they're hoping for right that you don't have a removal
46:15
spell combat trick or anything to just keep your Rampage in Raptor alive or even one combat like that because then it's over yeah this is this is just on
46:23
rate it's a it's an a rampaging Raptor all right another Prater it's urabrasque and you
46:30
know the the one named predators are here so this is two red red for a 4-4 legendary frexian Predator at Mythic
46:38
rare it does have first strike and whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell it does one damage to Target
46:46
opponent and it also says add red and it and then you can pay a red to
46:52
Exile it and return it to the battlefield transformed under its owner's control at sorcery speed and
46:58
only if you've cast three or more instant and or sorcery spells this turn they did make it just red though I mean
47:05
this is one Mana in addition when you play your third spell you get the red Mana even to pay for this exactly
47:12
so what does it become the great work kind of a weird name it is also a saga
47:19
and uh chapter one is the great work deals three damage to Target opponent
47:24
and each creature they control chapter two is create three treasure
47:30
tokens and chapter three is intelligent of turn you may cast instant and sorcery spells
47:35
from any graveyard if a spell cast this way would be put into a graveyard Exile
47:40
it instead and Exile the great work and return it to the battlefield as ER brask
47:46
again so this is the hardest one that we've seen
47:52
to flip you know we're going to see more of these of course uh seems because very difficult playing three instances and
47:58
sorceries in the same turn is a lot still four Mana 4-4 first strike with some pretty significant upside is is not
48:05
is not a bad place to be and if you can build a deck that that
48:11
has this that does the work for this I I think that you'll be really happy with the result well let's give it two grades
48:16
then okay let's put it into a normal deck where casting three instances and sorceries in the same turn will be
48:22
almost impossible right you might have four or five total in the deck yeah a couple of them might cost five Mana or
48:27
four Mana so that's just not gonna be on the table so you have a four Mana four four first strike and it does do the
48:34
extra damage to the opponent and you do get the Mana Advantage just if that happens to pop up you know for those few
48:40
times that you do sometimes you will cast a spell even if you're never casting three right right so where does
48:46
that put us no four Mana four four first strike is B
48:51
plus is B plus range yeah okay with that extra little ability now let's say your
48:58
blue red spells and you're actually you're trying to flip it now that is not going to guarantee it it is still a difficult thing to do you need a lot of
49:04
very cheap instance and sorceries which can make your deck worse Etc but let's say you have now a shot at actually
49:10
doing it we're into the a range pretty easily right certainly I mean yeah if
49:15
you're the kind of deck that this flips easily in Imagine like or play this on turn four and your opponent doesn't kill
49:22
it you could just flip it the next turn the the the the the bottleneck's gonna be having the three spells more so than
49:30
uh that needing uh the Mana to cast them because it gives you a pretty pretty
49:36
solid rebate on it would you try to lean that build towards red spells because of
49:42
the rebate if you can yeah I mean can trips are going to be the most important because getting to draw extra cards
49:48
makes it a lot more likely you'll assemble those three spells but
49:54
it's such a big threat I think if I was playing against someone who's blue red and they played this I would try to kill it pretty much as soon as I could yeah
50:01
and also it's just an insane blocker and attacker too so b-plus and easy a for
50:07
the build around um what does Chandra hopes Beacon do before red red for a legendary
50:14
Planeswalker Chandra at Mythic rare with five loyalty whenever you cast an
50:19
instant or sorcery spell copy it you may choose new targets for the copy this ability triggers only once each turn so
50:25
that's just a straight up static ability the first spell you play gets copied second it's she's got a plus two add two
50:33
mana and any combination of colors okay plus one Excel the top five cards in your library until the end of your turn
50:39
you may cast an instant or sorcery spell from among those exiled cards so this one's tough and limited because it just
50:45
straight up Exiles five cards every time that's a lot so you're not going to be you know
50:51
jamming on this one but then she has a minus X Chandra deals X damage to each
50:56
of up to two Targets so when you use the minus X you're basically
51:02
in a spot where you get to play Chandra and you deal -4 it deals four to two Targets six Mana
51:09
kill your two four four is just wow right off the bat you're not splitting up that damage that's crazy
51:15
yeah so I mean that's pretty huge I mean that alone would make Chandra quite strong she's also got cool play patterns
51:22
like play Chandra plus two and then play a cheap removal spell that immediately gets copied insane uh you've got the
51:29
ability to play Chandra and then if you have Mana left over or she survives a turn you just might use the plus one to
51:35
try to look for something else because you can use that twice and be fine in most games you just probably can't use
51:40
it four times and then the minus X is so huge I mean imagine Chandra plus two up
51:45
to seven play a bounce spell bounce two things oh untap minus six or minus seven and just
51:53
completely nug uh your opponent for a ton like still have your planes like
51:59
that that is great so I think Chandra gets an a I do too probably an A plus honestly yeah I mean this is especially
52:05
with the amount of loyalty we're talking about here you know six Mana comes down at five goes up to either six or seven
52:12
could go down in loyalty but then it's it's getting immediate value yeah I like a I like straight up a for chandra's
52:18
Chandra hope speaking and then if you put any effort into the build around part where you're the blue red instance
52:24
and sorceries deck then then it's going to be the easiest a plus you've ever seen because that static ability is worth a card not a six Mana card but
52:30
it's worth a card on its own um Italy Primal conqueror is next I love
52:37
these dinosaurs by the way five red red for a seven seven legendary Elder dinosaur at rare it's a trampler so
52:44
seven Mana seven seven trample when it enters a battlefield each player Exiles cards from the top of their Library
52:49
until they Exile a non-land card you may cast any number of spells from among the
52:55
non-land cards Exile this way without paying their Mana costs
53:02
and you're getting one from them and from you yeah oh my God I so this is a regular
53:09
rare I mean compare this to the you know beyond the Multiverse card that that milled 10 and put the creature into play
53:15
from each player this is seven Mana for a seven seven trample plus the top spell of each player's deck oh my God you
53:23
can't whiff either it just goes until it hits a spell and you get both spells right now and here's the crazy part
53:29
Louise I'm not even done there's more you can pay nine anaphoraxian green to transform it at
53:36
sorcery speed admittedly that is a ton of Mana but still it becomes Italy Primal sickness
53:43
which is an 11 11 trample indestructible legendary Fricks and Elder dinosaur and
53:51
whenever uh it deals combat damage to a player they get that many poison
53:57
counters so I mean whatever just win the game off of your seven Mana
54:04
three for one yeah I would think so I mean Italy I think gets an a as well that's just an
54:10
unbelievable card this could be an A plus yeah I mean this is pretty close to a
54:16
plus yeah I would be fine giving Italian a plus I mean seven Mana seven seven trample plays two spells in addition to
54:23
it and then if they don't get rid of this then maybe in a turn or two you can also just transform it if you need to
54:28
not that I think it's gonna it's gonna be too necessary right I mean your seven seven trampler is going to clean up the
54:34
game pretty nice with the two spells that you got for free but you know the bar for a plus is usually like if if I'm
54:40
behind can I cast this and expect to live or turn the game around and I think the answer is yes like
54:52
not be good enough right I like a plus for Italy this is better than some of
54:57
the mythics that card's insane uh next is City on fire this is five red red for
55:05
an enchantment at rare it does have convoke and it says if a source you
55:10
control would deal damage to a permanent or player it deals triple that damage instead
55:18
yeah it's quite the card so how do you how do you
55:24
let's take the Mana cost off out of the equation here is it is it worth a card
55:31
to have let's say the doubling effect that what was called furnace yeah
55:37
made everything Bill double damage even your opponent's stuff but uh so if you're just asking what does it do to
55:43
basically make all your stuff deal double damage it's not as good as probably plus two plus two to your team
55:49
okay but it's probably comparable or better than plus one plus one
55:56
triple so triple is is very close to just all your creatures get like plus X Plus o it acts as like a large number
56:03
like your two twos deal six your one ones deal three your four fours deal 12. it it stops mattering at some point like
56:09
obviously every Point can matter but right you just are in a spot where like
56:15
you're five five dealing 15. yes it does mean they probably shouldn't block it but or they probably shouldn't let it
56:22
through rather but it's not gonna you know make it so that dealing 15 and
56:28
dealing 10 aren't that different you know based on the situation and how good is this effect
56:34
right because like for example your three three still trades with their three three even though yours did nine
56:41
right now if it gets through game ends real quick yeah but you had to spend a whole card
56:48
and you didn't actually add anything it doesn't make your creatures more likely to survive unless they have first strike
56:54
right like then it's your three three trades for another three three like you said trample I how does transfer work
57:00
it's weird so let's say you have a 3-3 trample uh-huh and they block with a one one yeah you can assign one to the
57:07
creature two to the opponent and then the opponent takes six but it doesn't deal nine minus one ah interesting
57:15
so yeah it's not it's not that quite that easy they take
57:20
six okay where do you like this I mean this is a very difficult card because the raw
57:25
power is absolutely there but these types of cards are kind of fragile
57:31
right like they need a board if you don't have a if you're not a head on board if you're not able to do anything they do a lot less right like
57:38
they make your creatures trade yeah I don't know man it does just feel
57:45
though like triple is just such an obscene anything with two power or more just
57:51
becomes this like insane threat like I would assume that you play City on fire and then you win the game a lot of the
57:58
time if you can get through for anything part of the problem is yes it has convoked so it's not like an eight Mana
58:03
spell but if you're tapping five lands and three creatures you don't have much of an attack left that turn no that's
58:09
true it just didn't add to the board in a way that will protect you a whole lot either not at all
58:15
so yeah I am I am a little I'm a little concerned about that I think that I
58:20
think that there is some amount of this is a win more card in a variety of
58:25
ways I do you know it's weird because even though it works really well with big creatures I almost want to see it in
58:31
a deck with just a bunch of like tutus and you know three powered small creatures that you can like dump a bunch
58:38
of those creatures on the board and then on turn four five or six just tap everything out to play City on fire and
58:44
now every creature you have actually matters like you you attack with your tutu and your opponent really has to consider you know how they're going to
58:51
manage this yeah that said if they can then see it on Fire doesn't do anything again if you're behind it does something
58:58
but not really what you want I'm kind of thinking this card's not good I I think kind of leaning that way
59:04
myself I think it's like a build around sea where if you can really go hard on the convoke stuff this could do
59:11
something it's it's kind of funny because like it also works the least well with like one one tokens compared to a tutu but still if you can reliably
59:19
cast this and get to a point where it's actually on the board and you have a decent amount of creatures and you're
59:24
not dead then it's game over yeah my guess is this card's not going to
59:30
have a very good win rate I'm gonna go build around B and I want to build it around small creatures rather than big witch might seem counter-intuitive okay
59:38
that's it for Red did not get all A's but it did pretty good um green is next
59:43
deep root excuse me deep root wayfinder is the first card it's one in a green for a two three merfolk Scout at rare it
59:50
says whenever it deals combat damage to a player or battle surveil one then you may return a land card from your
59:57
graveyard to the battlefield tapped so two minute two three is pretty beefy
1:00:02
on turn two it is and then if they can't block it you get to surveil and if you hit a land you just get a land for free
1:00:08
that's pretty cool that's cool this looks like a B I mean you're gonna draw this in the middle of the game it's gonna be kind of a vanilla creature
1:00:15
because it's never getting through but that's fine what the terms of the games you draw it on turn two it can kind of dominate so that sounds like a B for me
1:00:22
yeah I like b as well next is invasion of Aquaria which is green green X for a
1:00:28
battle this one does have six defense and it says when invasion of Aquaria
1:00:34
enters a battlefield search your library and or a graveyard for a non-human creature card with Mana value X or less
1:00:41
and put it onto the battlefield if you search your library this way Shuffle
1:00:46
so you're adding a premium to whatever it is that you go whatever non-human creature card you search up a
1:00:52
significant one as well of double green if you can manage to get this thing dead though it becomes
1:00:59
zelortha Apex of Aquaria which is an 8-8 legendary dinosaur with reach and it
1:01:05
says for each non-human creature you control you may have that creature assigning its combat damage as though it
1:01:10
weren't blocked so it's an 88 super trampler
1:01:16
this one I'm not really in love with though right like I I have to pay green green X to you know I have to pay
1:01:23
five Mana to get a three drop for this thing is that okay yeah and that's not great
1:01:29
it's not a great deal and it is a little bit limited by the non-human Clause though
1:01:35
I don't think that that's such a big deal in this set I don't know and then and then you've got this huge battle you have to win
1:01:42
it's six freaking defense like I don't know I I'm not that thrilled with it
1:01:49
I might be understating it a little bit like maybe you have a bunch of extra Mana or maybe it's you know anytime you
1:01:54
can get a battle up and just have that opportunity yeah this looks like one of those battles that you should just probably not put in your deck like
1:02:00
you're gonna spend six Mana to get a four power creature or four cost creature and then you have a six defense
1:02:05
battle that's just not hard to like it's not easy to flip that like where are you doing that you know if it would would
1:02:12
this go up for you if you had like or something which we'll get to in just
1:02:19
a bit like where you tack on an extra two make it into a seven drop and go search it up
1:02:25
but it's like your best card or whatever you have to have something pretty good I
1:02:31
think in order to okay this isn't working for me yeah
1:02:38
um I I would probably give this an F I just think I I don't think you could pay that premium I don't think so either this is
1:02:45
sort of like the Trap that people fall into with uh with demonic tutor style cards where you're like I can get any
1:02:50
card I want for only four Mana it's like yeah you that doesn't really work the way you want it to uh all right next one
1:02:56
is invasion of ixalan this one's one in a green so just a two Mana uh four defense battle and it says
1:03:04
when it enters the battlefield look at the top five cards of your library you may reveal a permanent card from among
1:03:10
them and put it in your hand put the rest on the bottom in a random order and if you can get the four defense down
1:03:16
and win the battle it becomes belligerent regisaur which is a 4-3 trample dinosaur that says whenever you
1:03:23
cast a spell it gains indestructible until on the turn this one I like I mean two Mana to get a
1:03:31
permanent out of the top five is just passable it's not like great but it's think of it like an anticipate yep
1:03:37
you it's kind of like a space filler you'll put the card in your deck even if you're not like super stoked about it
1:03:43
right yeah but then it leaves behind this four defense battle that flips into a pretty substantial card like uh a card
1:03:49
I'm definitely not embarrassed to play definitely and it's it's early enough yeah you know it doesn't help you flip
1:03:55
the battle but whatever it can find lands it can find a your three drop it feels like you're kind of getting the
1:04:01
battle on the battlefield for free ish or at least a very low cost and then yeah if you decide to put the resources
1:04:08
in and flip it you'll be happy I like C plus for invasion of ixalan
1:04:14
which I realize is a weird grade but the front side is not a card I'd really
1:04:19
want to play unless I had additional upside and the additional upsides there but not amazing so so I go I land on C
1:04:26
plus for it perfect grade I think that's where that's where I would land as well what is uh ozilith the shattered Spire
1:04:33
do it says one in a green for a legendary artifact at rare uh if one or more plus one plus one
1:04:40
counters would be put on artifact or creature control put that many plus one plus one counters plus one on it instead
1:04:46
so every time something is going to get plus plus one counters it gets one more one in a green tap put a plus one plus
1:04:52
one count on target artifact or creature you control as a sorcery and cycling to kind of randomly wow
1:04:59
that's incredible so by itself it's two Mana two tap put two plus one plus one counters On Target
1:05:06
creature or artifact you control so you can actually start stacking the counters on one of your incubates if you want if
1:05:11
before you even want to flip it um it also works with all the like incubate slash white green slash
1:05:18
whatever all that stuff like it were it's kind of like a pseudo Lord and then it also just kind of has cycling which I
1:05:24
find funny like I don't know I do too but I love it because you know there are board states where you're looking and
1:05:30
you're going I don't have any creatures right now or there's no way I'm going to have enough time to actually start piling up
1:05:36
counters so I can just bail on it yeah
1:05:41
that's awesome yeah I think I mean those counters add up really fast right like I mean imagine
1:05:48
you play a three drop right and then they play a three drop then turn four like play this put two counters my thing attack you for five right they can't
1:05:54
block and then they if they kill your creatures sure maybe you know you're you traded one point and you spent extra
1:06:00
Mana but then next turn it's turned it's turn five you play another two or three Mana creature and then just use ozolith
1:06:06
it's like you played a five drop except later when you you still have those five drops to play right and then next turn
1:06:12
you can put it on an attack again it makes every creature in your deck something that must be dealt with
1:06:18
admittedly at a cost like that it is not free by any stretch of the imagination but this seems well worth it to me and I
1:06:25
love the cycling just in the fact that like if that game plan isn't there you can just jump shift jump ship and and go
1:06:30
a different direction a minus for azaleth it's also just gonna really pop off in the Decks that already have all
1:06:36
this stuff going on like right it's going to be closer to an A plus in those decks definitely a minus for Oslo this
1:06:41
card just seems to be the type of card that can completely take over the game reborn is next this is green green Green
1:06:49
for a four five legendary Hydra at rare it's got reach and it has six and a
1:06:56
white forexian Mana to transform it at sorcery speed and it becomes palucronose engine of Ruin which is a legendary
1:07:04
forexian Hydra that is a six six reach LifeLink
1:07:10
when I said I like cards you know in the a plus range that that are make make it
1:07:16
so you can't lose on the next combat well that covers all your bases there it says whenever it uh or another non-token
1:07:23
Hydra you control dies you get a 3-3 green and white frexian Hydra creature
1:07:28
token with reach and another one with LifeLink so flashbacks to or worm coil
1:07:34
yeah yeah so now the question is is are you transforming that like look let's
1:07:40
take this in order the Mana here is very difficult right we're looking at a triple green to get
1:07:46
it onto the battlefield so if you're playing let's say a 9 8 split towards
1:07:52
forests does that make this equivalent to roughly a six drop
1:07:59
yeah I think it's closest seven I think it's close to a six drop okay so if I
1:08:04
said let's say four green green for a four or five reach
1:08:09
that wouldn't excited but you could do worse right
1:08:14
four green green for uh four or five reach yeah I think I'd be pretty unhappy about that
1:08:20
because you should be paying five for that right yeah but
1:08:25
if you can get to six mana and this one really you can just get to six Mana because this thing has LifeLink I mean
1:08:31
now you're getting a six six reach LifeLink like if you can flip that on your turn and just jam with it that's
1:08:36
pretty awesome yes that if you're able to to flip it it just
1:08:42
becomes unbelievable right so this is a late game card where do you see it fitting in given its triple green Mana
1:08:48
cost I think that this is powerful enough that you what you would basically is
1:08:54
going to happen if you have blue chronosis you're going to try to to make it so that you can play 10 uh forests or
1:09:01
so and then you're gonna play this in the turn five or six range but also yes not being able to play at turn six
1:09:08
is a drawback but getting to play it turn six and still having three men left over to spend on something else is still
1:09:14
quite relevant it is would you play it in a 9-8 split towards
1:09:19
for us you kind of have to right it's still worth it yeah you would just put this card in
1:09:25
your deck I think so too I think it's good enough that you would be you'd be happy enough to do that all right so if we're clearing the hurdle
1:09:31
for Mana what grade does it get because it looks great to me if you can cast it I mean really I mean this is
1:09:37
like this is an a-level card definitely it's a four or five breach it's not the easiest to kill and then when you flip it into a six six reached LifeLink you
1:09:44
get that attack for six Health right away and then if they kill it health you
1:09:49
tack with your unit and you get your six all right uh it's life you can't call it
1:09:56
health on our that's like if we had a basketball podcast and you're like yeah he scored a lot of touchdowns last game
1:10:02
or something I look I I understand you know yeah it's
1:10:08
easy for me I only play Magic get it mixed up no but but I hear you
1:10:13
even if it died in that attack you're still happy with the outcome yeah is kind of what I'm saying and uh
1:10:21
yeah I think it's worth trying to bias your Mana a little bit and it's just it's an A minus like if you can get to
1:10:27
10 or 11 forests it's even better but either way it's it's quite good the only drawback is the triple green but yeah
1:10:33
once you're there a minus for pollution reborn Nexus tribute to the world tree this is also triple green but it's an
1:10:41
enchantment rare and it says wherever a creature enters the battlefield under your control draw a card if its power is
1:10:47
three or greater otherwise put two plus one plus one counters on it wow
1:10:54
getting this on the battlefield would be nice yeah but this this to me
1:11:02
is like almost an F which is weird but you need to have this down and then cast
1:11:09
creatures after it's down and like with polucinos reborn that's not the case in it is a great permanent
1:11:17
to have on the battlefield whenever you can cast it that is not true for tribute if this is the last card out of your
1:11:22
hand you're kind of hanging on for the ride and hoping you draw creatures if you're mono green and you cast this on turn
1:11:29
three I think this card's excellent like everything you do after it is just loading up your hand or building out a huge board
1:11:36
yeah they they really knew what they were doing with the casting cost on this one I think they got us pretty good
1:11:41
because if this is two in a green you'd be really happy with this car very happy you just play it on turn three and then you just start racking up the value of
1:11:48
drawing cards putting counters just getting all this stuff the problem is in the paluchronose situation where you
1:11:53
can't cast this until turn six all of a sudden how many creatures do you have left so this is like a build around a
1:11:59
where like yes if you if you can build a 12 Forest Mana base and play this card
1:12:04
it's gonna be awesome for you if you can play it early it's just not that good if you can't play it till late yeah I
1:12:11
we'll give it a build around a but as a normal card I would say it's like a D minus or an f i i i don't think on a
1:12:18
normal Mana base that you're going to be able to get this down consistently enough to take advantage
1:12:24
um what does Ren and realm breaker do this is uh one green green for a
1:12:29
legendary Planeswalker Wren at Mythic rare sorry the Mythic and the gold symbols are pretty similar to me
1:12:36
um so for loyalty static ability of land view control have Tappan one man of any
1:12:42
color okay plus one up to one target land you control becomes a three three Elemental creature with vigilance hex proof and
1:12:48
haste until your next turn it's still a land so this defends itself oh so it's
1:12:54
until your next turn until your next turn yes minus two mil three cards you may put a
1:13:00
permanent card from among the milled cards just those three cards into your hand and minus seven you get an emblem with
1:13:07
you may play lands and cast permanent spells from your graveyard that's a cool card only a three three Mana four
1:13:15
loyalty and a decent plus one on it as well yeah it doesn't untap the land right
1:13:22
no so if you play this on turn three you won't have something to defend with okay and you can plus one but not turn the
1:13:30
land into a creature if you'd like uh right
1:13:35
yes you can just you can just use the plus one and not do anything with it if that's if that's what you want to do okay
1:13:42
so how good is this thing I mean it seems great to me
1:13:48
so you play this for three make making your lands tap for any colors kind of whatever right
1:13:56
um and then you plus it to five say go they attack it hmm
1:14:04
it's a little less exciting so I guess you really want to play this on turn four
1:14:10
yes I think that you want to play this where you can keep the land around and uh unlock yeah it also has vigilance
1:14:17
so you do get to even attack them with them yeah turn four it's really strong but turn three I wonder if it's just two
1:14:22
Shields down you know for even at five loyalty it may survive that combat but
1:14:28
you give up a lot yeah and uh late in the game it doesn't
1:14:34
really protect itself that well because it doesn't give reach it gives vigilance and hex proof so they at least can't
1:14:41
kill the uh creature that you the land and get to get through or whatever yeah
1:14:47
I think red and realm breaker looks pretty mediocre to me like minus three minus two draw a card but it's draw a
1:14:54
permanent from the top three cards here deck right now I guess this is a cheap enough Planeswalker with enough loyalty no this
1:15:00
is fine this is like a b yeah it's I think it's it's a solid Planeswalker there's some games where you're not
1:15:05
gonna have a whole lot of stuff to do with this but if you can defend it it does help you with those lands
1:15:10
reasonably well then you're gonna end up feeling feeling all right about the whole deal I think so too it's a b or
1:15:16
trending towards B plus I just think that you really probably want to wait to play it on four more often than not
1:15:22
uh next is doomscar Warrior which is two green green for a 4-3 human Warrior at rare it's got backup one and then all of
1:15:30
this trample so that's kind of cool and then it says whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player or
1:15:35
battle look at that many cards from the top of your library that many being the the amount of damage okay you may reveal
1:15:43
a creature or land card from among them and put it into your hand put the rest on the bottom in a random order nice
1:15:51
means you're pretty likely to hit backup one and trample means if you have like a 3-3 in play you make it a 4-4 trample
1:15:57
maybe they don't have a good block and you kind of get to draw an extra card and you're left with a 4-3 trample that
1:16:03
has this like Saboteur ability whenever it hits and the trample of course helps or really solid card four Mana five four
1:16:09
trample with that ability yeah sure that's like the worst case scenario yeah that's an A minus Doom scar Warrior is
1:16:16
just a really good card yeah I think so too this is another one that's just pushed on rate next is glistening Dawn
1:16:22
this is also two green green this is a sorcery rare it says incubate X twice or
1:16:29
X is the number of lands you control I like this card a lot I think it look
1:16:35
think about this on six Mana right that's like the natural price point of this cast this make two incubate sixes
1:16:42
immediately incubate one so you paid six Mana for a six six that leaves a six six in play okay that's incredible
1:16:49
yeah what if you play it on turn four you don't have anything but the next turn you can wake up two four fours
1:16:56
yeah that I think you don't want to do very often obviously if you have to you have to but I think that you will end up
1:17:03
in a spot where you cast this on six a lot of the time that that seems like the
1:17:08
the place to be that's very powerful yeah just you're getting two huge creatures for a
1:17:16
reasonable rate on either right you said six so you've you're gonna have
1:17:22
to put in a total of six minutes six six and then next turn you get to wake up another six six yeah that's great eight
1:17:28
Mana for two six sixes that you can do on an installment plan however you want that is awesome
1:17:34
I hmm I mean this is good right is it an A
1:17:42
minus is it just an a like that's like the thing you describes really good
1:17:48
yeah like that's the type of car that it isn't flashy but like if your opponent
1:17:53
is just like here's the six six an extra and there's another one it's just like how am I gonna that's just too much
1:18:00
it's it it's a it's a lot of action like your opponent's gonna really feel it when you when you activate the second
1:18:06
one and if imagine on eight Mana you just make two eight eights right away yeah I I'm tempted to give it a B plus
1:18:12
but my intuition says that it's actually an A minus actually
1:18:18
so I'm gonna go a minus I like a minus I'm glistening Dawn this this feels like one of those cards that's gonna break stalemates wide open totally the biggest
1:18:25
downside is if they can deal with the first one then they they get a little bit of uh Tempo based on that but if you still
1:18:33
have a second one sitting here but I mean it's the tempo that they would have gotten if they killed your colossal dread mod the Turn You cast it right
1:18:39
it's like you live with it you know you pay six Mana for a creature sometimes they kill it next is invasion of
1:18:45
chandelar oh man they're going way back this is three green green for a four
1:18:51
defense battle that says when it enters a battlefield return up to three Target permanent cards from your graveyard
1:18:59
to your hand and then if you can get the four defense
1:19:04
down it becomes leyline surge which is an enchantment that says at the beginning of your upkeep you may put a
1:19:10
permanent card from your hand onto the battlefield man this is a this is one that really
1:19:18
puts that carrot way out front right or it's like if you can do it you're drawing three and you're getting all
1:19:24
this free stuff but man if you don't it's like the downside of this card is
1:19:30
so much higher right five Mana doesn't affect the board at all and you may not get the three cards you
1:19:38
may not get two you may get one or even zero in some bad scenarios where like
1:19:43
you're just staring at this card it doesn't because it doesn't Mill you it doesn't add you have to have permanent
1:19:49
somehow enter you know basically you have to have creatures have died or milled yourself
1:19:54
yeah it's this one's tough this one's a lot of like well but if it works out
1:20:01
exactly the way we want then then it then it does the thing you know totally I'm gonna go lower on invasion of
1:20:08
yeah I think this card is going to underperform based on yeah compared to most people's expectations of
1:20:14
you're going to look at this at five Mana draw three and then maybe it flips into this giant Mana generating machine
1:20:20
uh I think what's often going to happen is you're going to have this card and you're going to be like well I have two
1:20:26
only two Targets I guess that's okay or I have one good Target and like one bad one and that's like and then oh I can't
1:20:33
really flip it because I spent five Mana not affecting the board right and then you do flip it you have to wait a whole turn cycle to put a thing into play
1:20:39
just you may just look down and have had the Mana for it anyway
1:20:44
honestly I think invasion of Chandler I would give it a sideboard B I would bring it in in attrition battles yes I
1:20:50
would typically not want to think I would index cards I mean there's a one and a green you know uh get a permanent
1:20:58
back from your graveyard that that card sees play or sees print almost never sees play I don't think that that
1:21:04
ability scales well it's not like it gets better the more pressure you put on having good permanence so I don't think
1:21:11
I would play invasion of chandelier outside of the scenario that you said uh somebody's gonna have to beat me with it
1:21:16
I wanted my deck against you when you're we're both playing like green black against green blue
1:21:22
but yes in general I don't think this is this is uh what where you want to be I'm
1:21:28
gonna go D minus on invasion of chandelier I'm saying it's a sideboard B I think it's a good card yeah yeah but
1:21:35
not a card I would want to main deck uh Warren clex is next so I mentioned it what does it do it's three green green
1:21:41
for a legendary forexian Prater at Mythic rare it is a six six trample
1:21:48
reach for five which puts it as like a b-plus knocking on a
1:21:56
yeah I mean that's just pretty big and it's great on defense and it's great on offense and it's super efficient so
1:22:02
that's really great then it says when it enters the battlefield search your library for up to two Forest cards
1:22:07
reveal them then put them into your hand and Shuffle so you just get two extra land cards then you can pay six green
1:22:15
green Exile it and return it to the battlefield transformed at sorcery speed this one doesn't have any cheapening
1:22:21
though you just got to pay the full amount and it is the grand Evolution which of course is a saga chapter one
1:22:27
mill yikes 10 cards put up to two creature cards from among them milled
1:22:33
cards onto the battlefield all right fine fine fine chapter two distribute seven plus one plus one counters among
1:22:40
any number of Target creatures you control what and chapter three is and
1:22:45
talent of turn creatures you control gain one this creature fights Target creature you don't control and then you
1:22:51
Exile this thing and return it back as foreign clicks
1:22:57
maybe in a commander game you need all this extra stuff but I mean
1:23:02
you've already won like this is ludicrous right like it's not close
1:23:10
um anyway this is an A plus yeah I mean look what up well have you thought about the situation where you
1:23:15
cast this and then they kill they kill it you only got a three for one because you got two lands
1:23:21
like just ludicrous it stabilizes the board
1:23:27
it's the best attacker at its Mana slot and then it has this Grand evolution is
1:23:32
just insane like seven plus one plus one counters however you want among
1:23:38
creatures you control and somehow you were so bad that you got two free lands
1:23:43
two free creatures on the battlefield seven plus one plus encounters you didn't manage to win the game at that point and you get to do it all again
1:23:50
after your creatures can just fight everything for one Mana each I mean
1:23:57
to me is almost getting to the point where you're just like it's almost unimaginative it's so
1:24:04
brutally good you know at any rate it's an A plus for vortic so
1:24:09
EGA plus um last green card is ancient empirosaur this is five green green for a six six
1:24:16
dinosaur rare it's got convoke it has trample it has ward two
1:24:22
and it enters the battlefield with two plus one plus one counters on it for each creature that convoked it
1:24:30
this is gonna be like five Mana for a 10 10 trample ward two it was kind of kind
1:24:36
of the way I would like to start to look that is exactly what I was thinking and that I mean that's fantastic it's
1:24:42
incredible no no no I have no issue with that at all I do not either
1:24:49
okay I would how much does War 2 make it an a like
1:24:56
because I I'm thinking a minus for ancient Imperial because it's still pretty expensive and ultimately it's
1:25:02
just sort of a crap ton of power and toughness but it is like an insane amount of it
1:25:10
and it has trample yeah I was thinking an A minus for the imperius or
1:25:16
maybe just a flat a I don't know it's close either way yeah if I if you
1:25:22
get this card you do want to go hard on the cheap creatures because if you can cast this with three creatures on turn four the game is just so over and even
1:25:29
on turn five a lot of the removal that would kill this is very difficult to do with Ward 2 because
1:25:35
you're they're probably spending five men or four Mana to kill it so I think ancient Imperial sword does a lot of
1:25:42
work there I I just give it an A okay it's a great card a for just a huge amount of power and toughness all right
1:25:47
that moves us to White our first white card is progenitor exarch this is white XX for a one two
1:25:55
forexian cat cleric it's rare when uh when it enters a battlefield you
1:26:01
incubate three x times right so you play this for three minutes
1:26:08
you get a one two plus incubate three you place for five Mana you get a you get incubate three twice
1:26:14
you know that sort of thing and then the fact that it can tap to transform Target incubator token you control means the
1:26:20
one two is actually pretty relevant especially if you cast this for seven Mana you have a lot of tokens that you
1:26:25
want to transform how happy are you with the three Mana slot
1:26:30
pretty happy still three men and one two that put a token into play and if they don't kill the one two which I mean if
1:26:36
they do you're probably okay with them killing a one two if they don't just turn four you tap to transform it so you
1:26:43
got it's like a blade splicer you got a three three and a one two for three Mana and then this works with the other
1:26:49
incubate cards you have overall and then where do you think The Sweet Spot is is it three is it five
1:26:58
really this is a perfect example of a scaling card that I'm happy on three I'm
1:27:03
happy on five I'm happy on seven though I don't expect it to have to happen that to happen quite so much
1:27:09
I and I guess there's not really a world where you'd want to play it on one no that I don't really see happening
1:27:16
okay so what do you want to go B plus for progenitors yeah I think it's a solid little tube just a good card yep
1:27:23
no no real no real downsides uh dusk Legion duelist is one in a white for a 2-2 vampire soldier at rare it's got
1:27:30
vigilance and it says whenever one or more plus one plus one counters are put on dusk Legion duelist draw card this
1:27:36
ability triggers only once each turn it's actually not that great as a one in
1:27:42
a white two two vigilance right it's like okay you know sometimes those make it in it's okay but what's the plus one
1:27:48
plus some counters you're in business yeah I mean there's a lot of ways to do that and it makes all of them into into good good value plays
1:27:55
it's not quite playlist on turn two and just trade it off because you probably want to have this stick around so you
1:28:01
can get a little bit more value out of it but I'm really happy to put this card in any deck that has even like one or
1:28:06
two ways to get counters on it because also you play against a an opponent they don't know how well it works and you
1:28:13
play this they might go out of their way to kill it especially if they have sorcery speed removal because it's just one of those cards like I don't know
1:28:20
Marshall you're playing against yeah but opponent let's say playing white green is the worst but even like white black
1:28:25
and they play this card and they and they pass the turnover to you are you going to be like
1:28:31
yeah for sure and it also has it's a rare you know which makes people more
1:28:37
scared of it for whatever reason I mean I like build around B for dusk Legion duelist if you're doing plus one plus
1:28:43
one counters if you don't have any ways to do counters it's like a d Plus or
1:28:48
something like yeah c c minus sure two minutes two two vigilances not a card
1:28:54
you really want in your neck yeah it's like Fringe playable but but I like it as a as a solid build
1:29:00
around B if you're doing counters and I don't think you need to be doing that much either uh next is invasion of gobikan which is
1:29:08
one in a white for a oh this one's interesting this is only a three defense battle and it says when it enters the
1:29:14
battlefield look at Target opponent's hand you may Exile a non-land card from it for as long as the card remains
1:29:21
exiled its owner may play it a spell cast this way costs two more to cast
1:29:26
that doesn't remind you of something if you can get the three defense down it becomes light Shield array which is an
1:29:33
enchantment that says the beginning of your end step put a plus one plus one counter on each creature that attacked this turn
1:29:39
and then you can sacrifice this to give creatures you control hex proof and indestructible and talented turn
1:29:45
it's a little awkward yeah it so it does help if uh
1:29:52
you you can like kind of make it so that uh their curve is disrupted which helps you like maybe try to aggro out this
1:29:59
battle but it's it again doesn't affect the board
1:30:05
it is nice that when you play it you know you're you're uh when you flip it you're you're probably gonna get some
1:30:11
counters on some stuff yeah it's just tough because it's like it this one to
1:30:16
me gets you ahead on kind of a Razor's Edge and asks you to stay there and if if anything goes wrong
1:30:23
it's not great right like it's not actually taking a card from them right it's just slowing down that process a
1:30:29
little bit yeah then it's saying typically that effect by the way plays way better and constructed because it
1:30:34
limited your opponent eventually just cast the card and construct it it's not quite that easy exactly and then you
1:30:40
need to have have have the light Shield array down you know after you've attacked ideally
1:30:46
to to get it transformed Etc but man if that doesn't happen you know it can be
1:30:52
very difficult to get that for because you only need the plus and plus one counters thing to happen once right like
1:30:58
because then you're ahead and now you get to stay ahead because you can continue to attack but if your creature
1:31:03
gets killed or you can't flip it you really haven't done much
1:31:08
it seems very finicky also like imagine drawing this card in the late game
1:31:15
is it good then pretty bad mm-hmm like I'm not I'm not I'm just too
1:31:22
impressed with this it just feels like the array is saying if you had good attacks now they're really good
1:31:27
but the hard part is getting to having good attacks it's not making your creatures better after they've done so
1:31:33
yeah I'm a little down I'm a little down on the invasion of gobokon I could see it just running away with the game where
1:31:39
it's like the perfect curve it fits perfectly but man I think a lot of times you just want to play a two drop onto
1:31:47
you don't want to be playing this you know yeah I don't know this is what I'm I'm most
1:31:53
willing to be wrong about if there's uh if it just curves perfectly and it just sort of does its thing but it looks like
1:32:00
sketchy territory to me and I would give it a lower grade as a result I would give it like a c
1:32:06
yeah I think that I would give light Shield array slash invasion of gobicon probably like a c minus honestly it
1:32:12
doesn't look that good uh what does guardian of gear per do this is a tuna white for an angel at
1:32:18
rare it's a 3-3 flying wow and when it enters the battlefield XL to one target creature artifact you control return it
1:32:25
to the battlefield under its owner's control at the beginning of the next end step pretty great that's fantastic
1:32:32
is there is there an obvious use for the blink
1:32:37
there's I mean there's a bunch of creatures with ETB abilities okay but like it doesn't work on your tokens no
1:32:44
you don't want to Target your incubator that would not be be too effective yeah
1:32:49
still a three Mana three three flyer with any type of upside is something I'm already interested in I would go b-plus
1:32:55
on guardian of giripper it doesn't feel like the blink is like perfectly suited to the format I would go a minus it's a
1:33:02
three Mana three three flying and it probably does something decent with the turn you play it
1:33:08
I I would describe it as a three Mana three three flying that occasionally will do something decent
1:33:13
yeah these effects tend to be pretty good you want to play it on three though right like
1:33:19
yeah but you have one if you draw it on three it's still really good like it's a three three flyer but then in the late
1:33:25
game it's almost always like something right yeah does it give you it gets its value does it yeah but it's always in
1:33:32
like insane formats does this give you um does it give a creature visual like if
1:33:39
you attack with your tutu and then blanket you're good so that's already a little bit Yeah B plus a minus for
1:33:44
guardian of gear report that card's great uh next is invasion of Theros this is
1:33:49
two in a white for a battle it's got four defense and it says when it enters a battlefield search your
1:33:55
library for an aura God or demigod card reveal it put it in your hand and then
1:34:02
Shuffle and if you can get the thing if you can win the battle it becomes afara ever Sheltering which is a 4-4 legendary
1:34:10
god enchantment creature by the way and ivara ever Sheltering has LifeLink and
1:34:15
indestructible as long as you control at least three other enchantments and whenever another enchantment enters the
1:34:22
battlefield under your control you draw a card
1:34:28
this feels a little bit like what are you doing here like are you lost yeah this looks more like a constructed
1:34:33
card yeah paying three mana on top of the cost of whatever card you get to do something with it is just not a good
1:34:39
deal right and then again these are the kind of battles that I think are a little bit of a trap where you're just like paying three to maybe draw a card
1:34:46
not even every deck draws a card and then off of this and then if you
1:34:51
flip it it's good but it's not even like crazy so yeah I'm not super into uh Farah ever
1:34:58
Sheltering slash invasion of Theros yeah and and it it's just it just gets so difficult when they don't actually help
1:35:04
flip so I would go D on Invasion I I don't there may be a niche archetype or something
1:35:11
that we're not quite catching but it certainly doesn't just fit cleanly into the format yeah
1:35:17
holy crap Monastery mentors back oh yeah you you do love to see it I love Monastery Mentor me too it's a two in a
1:35:24
white for a 2-2 human monk at Mythic rare it has prowess and whenever you cast a non-creature spell you create a
1:35:32
1-1 white monk creature token with prowess
1:35:38
this is a one fantastic one card Army yeah I mean you just play this and
1:35:45
as long as you have any sort of non-creature spells to play after like it's just it's going to be ridiculous how how easy it is going to be to win
1:35:52
yep and any you can build around it you know in subtle ways you know a few extra can trips that you might not normally
1:35:58
play but even if you're just doing anything removal wise or card draw or anything Monastery Mentor completely
1:36:04
takes over a game anything at instant speed is extremely difficult for the opponent to plan for both when you're
1:36:10
attacking them and when they're attacking you I mean I give Monastery Mentor an a you
1:36:16
technically have to build around it a little bit by you know nothing that much but it's like non-creature spells it's
1:36:22
just like every deck has eight of those right so like there you go
1:36:29
so a for Monastery Mentor are you good with that no I love it Archangel else Beth is Nexus is too white white for a
1:36:36
four loyalty legendary elspeth at Mythic plus one create a 1-1 white Soldier
1:36:41
creature token with LifeLink oh how times have changed minus two uh
1:36:46
put two plus one plus one counters On Target creature it becomes an angel in addition to its other types and gains
1:36:53
flying and the ultimate is -6 return all non-land permanent cards with many value
1:36:59
three or less from your graveyard to the battlefield assume I will just be ignoring that part
1:37:05
yeah I mean not even necessarily you're like play Archangel else Beth plus one plus one and then maybe you've got a
1:37:12
couple things to get back but I just feel like I'd probably rather just keep making one ones or start
1:37:17
pumping them up but whatever because I get to keep else Beth like I get to keep the train rolling
1:37:23
um cards awesome I mean one one's with LifeLink to protect itself I mean the LifeLink is nice but even just any one
1:37:29
one the original elspeth Planeswalker had that and it was awesome then and
1:37:34
it's still great and then I mean there's a natural play pattern of Play This plus it
1:37:42
have else Beth not die then minus two you make a three three life linking
1:37:47
angel with flying there's really no wrong way to do this
1:37:52
no just just make sure that you activate it every turn and you'll be fine you can just randomly click which one of the
1:37:59
things um the only question is a or a plus a plus I mean sure you're again you're
1:38:07
going to play else Beth and I think your opponent is just gonna feel like they're completely screwed
1:38:12
yeah all right LS norn this is one of your favorite creatures what does Elish
1:38:18
norn do now so two white white for a three five legendary frexian prey turret
1:38:23
Mythic rare with vigilance it says whenever a sources okay whenever
1:38:28
a source an opponent controls deals damage to you or permit you control that sources controller loses to life unless
1:38:34
they pay one so it's kind of an obnoxious trigger to be honest because
1:38:41
a lot of the time your opponent is not necessarily going to
1:38:47
uh like there's a lot of Bookkeeping on Arena you're gonna have a bunch of triggers it's not though it's not the
1:38:53
most powerful trigger in the world it's it's not nothing but basically what it's going to end up
1:38:58
happening is you're gonna get to tax your opponent where they have to pay either life or mana and
1:39:05
kind of end up in a spot where they're not they're not faced with good decisions in any in any way there
1:39:13
and then extraordinarily annoying yes and then what's gonna happen is
1:39:19
if you have two in a white and you can sack two three other creatures you can Exile Elish norn and return to the
1:39:25
battlefield transformed as a sorcery so it's three mana and Sac three creatures
1:39:32
and then you end up uh getting the Argent etchings which is a saga like the
1:39:37
others the first chapters incubate two five times then transform all incubator
1:39:42
tokens you control so put five tutus into play creatures you control are the second
1:39:47
chapters creatures you control get plus one plus one in game double strike until I return your turn and then the chapter three is destroy
1:39:55
all other permanents except lands artifacts and frexians you control Exile
1:40:01
or sorry not you control just all other permanents except artifacts lands and frexians then Exile hardened teachings
1:40:07
and return it as English Norton so your playlist in order she's a three five vigilance which is pretty pretty
1:40:13
Burly to start with has this weird task for your opponent every time something gets into combat they have to pay too life for a Mana but
1:40:21
the real money is if you sack three other creatures all of a sudden you get five two twos then they all get plus one plus one and double strike and then it
1:40:27
blows up a bunch of stuff this this actually is not the strongest chapter three because uh some your opponent
1:40:34
might have a bunch of these things but it doesn't matter because you get Elitch norn back right and you got five three
1:40:39
three double Strikers on the way so yeah I mean the only question is how hard is
1:40:45
it to get to the point of sacrificing three other creatures and what's the risk involved with that yeah like if you
1:40:52
like if you pay the two in the white and sacrifice the creatures an ability Goes
1:40:58
On The Stack right that says yeah your opponent can definitely kill English Northern response okay
1:41:04
so there is a risk if you're opponent passes without your Mana maybe don't shove all in on this but right because
1:41:11
the other ones it's one thing to meet some requirement but then you just pay mana and if they interrupt it well they
1:41:17
were going to kill it anyway but here like you could blow up your whole board yeah I I think that this is an a whereas
1:41:25
the other Predators were an A plus I agree but still very very good insane card still four Mana three five
1:41:31
vigilance is already kind of like oh man that's huge uh next is heliod the radiant Dawn which is two white white
1:41:37
for a 4-4 legendary enchantment creature God at rare when heliod enters the battlefield return Target enchantment
1:41:44
card that isn't a god from your graveyard to your hand
1:41:50
and that's a lot of extra text in a set that doesn't care about enchantments or gods you can
1:41:56
pay three and aforexian blue to transform it at sorcery speed so you got
1:42:01
a four man of four four but the next turn you could just pay your three or four Mana depending to transform it into
1:42:07
heliod the Warped Eclipse which is a 4-6 legendary enchantment creature forexian
1:42:13
God that lets you cast spells as though they had Flash and spells you cast cost one less to cast for each card your
1:42:19
opponents have drawn this turn really weird but this is a bizarre card
1:42:25
yeah I I like I don't really get what's going on here but that's okay uh so the
1:42:32
front side of four four but you have to have an enchantment to get back which are not going to happen very which isn't
1:42:38
going to happen very often and then you can transform it to a four six that makes your spells one cheaper and your
1:42:44
opponents and you know it has flash this looks like a c honestly I don't I don't
1:42:49
think Helio is going to be that good I mean it has to be a little I mean I think a four Mana four four is above a c
1:42:56
Okay C plus yeah because occasionally you'll get a card back
1:43:03
this is doesn't fit into the set particularly well but has enough stats to get it into the playable plus range so C plus maybe
1:43:11
B minus if you've got a couple of targets that you could get enchantments next is boonbringer Valkyrie this is
1:43:17
three white white for a 4-4 angel warrior at rare it has backup one
1:43:23
and the thing gets flying first strike and LifeLink yeah this is Bane Slayer
1:43:30
um I mean bringer valky is an A plus like you play this you give one of your creatures this big LifeLink flying
1:43:35
attack and a plus muscle encounter permanently and then you just end up with a 4-4 flying First Strike LifeLink
1:43:40
you just play that for five minute without all the backup stuff a plus for Boone bringer Valkyrie agree this I
1:43:46
think might be end up being one of the best cards in the set this is the this is in some ways better than like a bane
1:43:53
Slayer Angel type card because of the backup ability to get that attack in so that you don't have to sit there and
1:43:59
wait for your opponent to have sorcery speed removal to kill your in this case Valkyrie and then kill you you could
1:44:05
survive even beyond that and as you mentioned the card itself just at face values already in a so that's an A plus
1:44:12
to me this could be one of the best cards in the set full stop easily next is night errant of EOS this
1:44:19
is four in a white for a 4-4 human night at rare it's got convoke I like that and
1:44:26
when Knight arentive EOS enters the battlefield look at the top six cards of your library you may reveal up to two
1:44:32
creature cards with Mana value X or less from among them where X is the number of creatures that convoked night Aaron of
1:44:40
EOS put the reveal cards in your hand and then Shuffle so that's actually not that great right
1:44:45
Luis like no if you use two features if you convoke it with two creatures you'll get six cards and then you can get two
1:44:52
two drops which are probably not gonna get out of six cards okay so you do get both in okay
1:44:58
yeah yeah still not great you you need to get to three to make it so that you can like have a shot at getting two
1:45:04
cards more reliably right yes still what are we like for a four and a
1:45:11
white 4-4 with convoke that would be like a solid comment in the set right yeah and if you convoke it with three
1:45:18
it's kind of close to a mole Drifter you you got a four four and you probably Drew at least a card maybe two and
1:45:25
obviously if you can not draw and convoke it for five you just draw whatever your top two creatures are and that's gonna be pretty good too yeah out
1:45:30
of six cards I like it I mean I look you know let's
1:45:36
not put it next to boonbringer Valkyrie but like this looks like a b to a B plus to me for for look a creature heavy deck
1:45:44
makes it uh you know work in every way right yes it uh it rewards you it
1:45:50
rewards you in both on both sides and yeah I think in a creature heavy deck you can you can call that air Antonio
1:45:56
it's like a B plus I agree and and even if you're not super creature heavy you can still play it
1:46:01
sun fall is our last white card actually it's three white white for a sorcery and
1:46:06
rare says Exile All Creatures incubate X where X is the number of
1:46:12
creatures exiled this way nice oh yeah fantastic sweet
1:46:19
yeah you end up getting one of the best wraths that we've seen in limited in quite some time out of this card definitely
1:46:26
especially at regular rare yeah not being a Mythic it's just a
1:46:32
straight up rare it's just very good I like it at a for sun full I think it's probably an A plus could be
1:46:39
it it Exiles too yeah that's huge too and you end up with like a six six in play like that's just incredible man I
1:46:48
think the only downside is that it is in white you know which is like a convoke creature heavy uh color where if this
1:46:54
was in black or something it might be even better but this is gonna like wreak havoc on sealed format this is gonna be
1:47:01
a card you're always going to have to consider if your opponent's in white how how all in do you want to go
1:47:06
yeah like a you like a plus for sunfall one more color to go and then we've got a few gold cards and very few uh
1:47:12
colorless but blue is our last color let's see if we save the best for last I don't think anything's beating black but
1:47:18
we'll see this is fairy Mastermind look familiar that is one in a blue for
1:47:25
a 2-1 fairy Rogue at rare it has Flash and flying and whenever an opponent
1:47:32
draws their second card each turn you draw a card but here's the thing it has
1:47:37
the activated ability of three in a blue each player draws a card and of course this is the card for you
1:47:45
to Takahashi our world champion from uh from last year yeah very cool super cool
1:47:51
so jealous you can see his own card um how good is it I mean is it two Mana
1:47:57
two one flash flyer which is already quite strong and then you know the joke here of course is that if you activate the ability on your opponent's turn you
1:48:04
get to draw an extra card in addition to the one that they get and the one that you get
1:48:11
so two minute two on flash flying obviously just a good start and then getting to bend four to make Dem draw
1:48:17
one and you and you draw One yeah yeah
1:48:24
I mean I think this is probably like an A minus very Mastermind it's a really good card you think so I was gonna go b-plus I think it's close I mean it's
1:48:33
it's so aggressive two men are two one flying Flash and then pretty easy to end
1:48:38
up in a spot where uh you you you're just respect pumping Mana into it and getting a lot of value and if even if
1:48:44
you don't end up doing that you you you just have this flying flash
1:48:49
creature that can attack and block and do all those things yeah I think the way I break it down is that the flash part
1:48:55
of it is fine but not really that relevant like it's it's okay it's true
1:49:00
right so now if we have a two one flash a two one flyer for two that's pretty
1:49:06
good you know that that that's C plus you know approaching B minus depending on on other factors but I re I feel like
1:49:15
you can only activate the active activated ability like maybe once in a game like if you've dumped eight Mana to
1:49:21
give your opponent two cards like you can have twenty like it you're just gonna lose because they're gonna just dump all the stuff on the battlefield
1:49:28
with their eight Mana that you that they didn't have to spend to get these cards in your hand so I feel like the times
1:49:33
when it's safe to actually activate this are are somewhat infrequent and it is not a particularly good defending
1:49:40
creature like it's it's it'll trade off with something small so it doesn't necessarily buy you the
1:49:45
time to use all those extra cards after the Mana deficit hit so I'm a little lower on it I you know I think it's like
1:49:51
a b like I think it's pretty good okay I could go b-plus all right it doesn't
1:49:56
seem does seem like a good card and at most stages of the game but I agree you can't activate it very often uh Rona
1:50:02
Harold The Flash actually matters for something relevant oh if you have six Mana no if your opponent doesn't know you
1:50:09
have this and casts a card draw spell you can Flash this in and then just draw a car that's nasty that's sick I mean
1:50:15
that seems relevant uh that's great um next is Rona Herald of invasion this
1:50:22
is one of the blue for a 1-3 legendary human Wizard and it says whenever you cast a legendary spell untap it oh man
1:50:30
sure uh you can tap it to draw a card and then discard a card all right so we've got a looter for two mana and
1:50:36
three toughness and then you can pay five in a frexian black to transform it at sorcery speed into Rona tellurian
1:50:42
obliterator which is a 5-5 legendary frexian Wizard with trample
1:50:49
why does this have trample whatever oh sure is it whenever a source deals
1:50:55
damage to Rona it sort of sounds like it uh that versus controller Exiles a card from their hand at random if it's a land
1:51:03
card you may put it on the battlefield under your control otherwise you may cast it without pain
1:51:09
it's Mana cost wow yeah this one's just ramped up and ramped up and ramped up
1:51:15
but uh you kind of had me at two Mana one three looter yeah two Mana one three
1:51:21
looter is already good and then you spend five in a black friction Mana to turn into this five five trample that
1:51:26
they really don't want to get into combat with five five unblockable this we can give
1:51:31
an A minus this is this is a very good card definitely I like a minus for RONA next is Chrome host seed shark this is
1:51:39
two in a blue for a two four flying pharexian shark at rare it says whenever
1:51:46
you cast a non-creature spell incubate X where X is that spells Mana value
1:51:54
hard these days do they Luis like we made a 2-4 flyer I mean the stats on
1:52:00
that are fantastic and then whenever you cast an uncreature spell you just generate value we'll just say
1:52:06
it spits out baby sharks you know sure that's one way to put it at least um
1:52:15
I actually I think I would just say a for Chrome host seed shark like it just
1:52:20
asks absolutely nothing of you for your three Mana
1:52:26
it's just incredible all right um next is invasion of Segovia
1:52:31
this is two in a blue for a battle with four defense when it enters the battlefield create two one one blue
1:52:39
Kraken creature tokens with trample uh the old one one tramplers and then if
1:52:45
you can get the four defense down it becomes cadis C Tyrant of Segovia which
1:52:51
is a 3-3 legendary serpent that says non-creature spells you cast have
1:52:59
convoke and then it says at the beginning of your end step untap up to four Target
1:53:04
creatures huh
1:53:10
becomes a 3-3 I guess yeah and in the convoke deck making two one ones for
1:53:15
three Mana is is not a bad deal that's true so you get I mean it's weird
1:53:21
because there's all this extra text but it really is just three men and make two one ones with trample and then if you
1:53:27
get it dead then it then you get a 3-3 out of the deal as well with some with some minor upside
1:53:33
yeah that seems fine I I am not excited about it
1:53:39
I I like that it makes two on ones that could potentially help you get this thing transformed with like a Tempo
1:53:45
player removal spell the next turn I like that so it plays into itself for not that much Mana yeah but the overall
1:53:52
upside on both sides isn't really that high yeah it's not that High I mean I don't
1:53:58
want to knock it too bad you know the sea turret works in the convoke deck by like you have all these creatures out
1:54:03
all your spells have convoke on top all your creatures it's this is more of like a build around bee like I think I'd want
1:54:08
to be doing something with all these rather than assume that uh this is just
1:54:14
good in any deck right I mean it it seems fine in any deck right like a joke
1:54:19
by the way if you don't know uh Segovia is a plane where everything is extremely
1:54:25
small
1:54:30
Krakens that are like the equivalently ten tens and segovian Angel and modern Horizons is a one one flying vigilance
1:54:37
but like in Segovia she's normal size but if this like tiny plane oh that's amazing I love that okay that's pretty
1:54:43
cool I actually want to give it a higher grade for that I will restrain myself but I'm glad you said that so so what I
1:54:49
mean this seems to me like a c like or a c plus in your in most decks
1:54:54
yeah I think it's I think it's a builder on B I think in your convoke deck where you're getting a lot of value out of
1:54:59
both halves of the card then I'd be pretty happy with the card I think in most decks it's not going to be great next is C double this is two blue for an
1:55:07
instant and rare it says this spell can't be copied choose one that's a weird sentence choose one if an
1:55:13
opponent has eight or more cards in their graveyard you may choose both copy Target spell you may choose new targets
1:55:20
for the copy the other one is create a token that's a copy of Target creature oh no
1:55:27
no well form it this is I have to add four
1:55:32
Mana no no no no what am I missing here it's four Mana to make a token that's a
1:55:40
copy of Target creature so it's a four minute instant speed Club oh oh sorry okay I got you now
1:55:45
so I I thought it was copying a creature on the stack for some reason I get you okay so that's uh
1:55:51
no but if you but you can copy Target spell so you could copy a creature on the stack oh okay right so you could but
1:55:58
but the much more relevant use for us is that second ability but I think they're both actually pretty
1:56:04
relevant like if they play a good ETB creature or fixing Gargantua you can I mean I guess I guess either way you can
1:56:11
copy it with the second part but oh I can steal their spells I see he was not steal because they that you
1:56:18
copy it so you so you get it and they do it they get it I think that I think they're both pretty relevant yeah
1:56:24
definitely this card seems and if and if you get to eight or more then you can lead cards in their graveyard you can
1:56:31
leave Mana up and then go see double copier spell also copy a creature and
1:56:36
get a really sick two for one I mean for two blue blue make a copy of a creature and play at instant speed yeah that's
1:56:42
like a B plus level card I think this card's close to like an A minus yeah I'm gonna stay at B plus but I'm with you
1:56:48
that this is this is very powerful instant speed creatures especially you
1:56:54
know can trade off in combat or trade you know change the game a lot just on its own yeah
1:56:59
I like C double you you want to go a minus I'll go a minus especially in a deck that can get them to eight cards
1:57:06
sometimes uh Transcendent message is next it's X
1:57:11
blue blue blue blue this is an instant it says draw X cards
1:57:19
but it has convoke so let's say to draw three cards you have to send seven Mana tap five lands
1:57:27
and two creatures or four lands and three creatures and that's to draw three cards which isn't even like gonna win the game I'm just gonna say F on
1:57:33
Transcendent message I think it's an F just don't go here don't go there and and trust us we would like to go there
1:57:40
but no next is Zephyr singer this is two blue blue for a three four
1:57:45
um siren pirate at rare it's got convoke it has flying and vigilance and when it
1:57:52
enters the battlefield put a flying counter on each creature that convoked it fantastic I mean you convoke this
1:57:58
with two creatures they can don't get to attack this turn it's actually a pretty elegant design in that sense you don't get to just Ambush them with Flyers but
1:58:05
you can vote this with a 2-2 and a three three all of a sudden you have three flying creatures on the board one of which is a three four flyer with
1:58:11
vigilance so and this one's not tap so you can actually stay alive yeah this just seems awesome I like an a for
1:58:16
Zephyr singer I mean I do too how unhappy are you to cast this for four Mana pretty pretty pretty happy it's
1:58:22
actually fine yeah and if you convoke it with just one creature that could be very strong yeah uh next is invasion of
1:58:31
arcavios which is three blue blue for oh whoa seven defense battle okay this
1:58:39
better be good when it enters the battlefield search your library graveyard and or outside the game so
1:58:44
that's your sideboard in our case for an instant or sorcery card you own reveal it put it into your hand if you search
1:58:51
your library this way you Shuffle and it be and if you do ever get this
1:58:56
thing transformed which I can't imagine you could it becomes invocation of the founders with which is an enchantment
1:59:02
that says whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell from your hand you may copy the spell you may choose new targets for the copy
1:59:08
nope yeah I I don't think about this I don't think this is a this is for limited I
1:59:14
would give invasion of our KBS and F I would too uh next is Jin gataxius our last Prater it's three blue blue for a
1:59:22
five five legendary frexian Prater Mythic it's got ward two whenever you
1:59:27
cast a non-creature spell with Mana value three or greater you draw a card
1:59:32
and you can pay three in a blue to Exile it return to the battlefield transformed under its owner's control and you can
1:59:38
activate only as a sorcery and only if you have seven or more cards in hand
1:59:44
really and it becomes the great synthesis chapter one draw cards equal
1:59:50
the number of cards in your hand you have no maximum hand size for as long as you control the great synthesis
1:59:56
and you had to have seven to flip it so you draw seven yeah okay uh and now you've got 14 cards chapter two return
2:00:04
all non-forexian creatures to their owner's hands chapter 3 you may cast any
2:00:10
number of spells from your hand without paying their Mana costs and then you Exile it and return it to the
2:00:15
battlefield as Gene gataxius all right finally one that we can actually knock on a little bit here
2:00:21
right I mean you're still getting a five Mana five five Ward 2 so it's not like we can give it a bad grade or anything like that but
2:00:28
seven cards in hand come on yeah seven cards is is gonna happen so
2:00:35
basically this one we can just do five Mana five five Ward 2 with the extra ability of whenever you cast a
2:00:41
non-creature spell with converted excuse me Mana value three or greater you draw a card
2:00:47
that's pretty good I'm five and you probably can't kill it it's a
2:00:53
five five it has ward two and then next turn you just cast a random spell and draw a card
2:00:59
it's pretty good this is like a b though it's like the rest of them are flat A's Jenga tactics is a b yeah I feel bad for
2:01:06
gin uh last blue card is complete the circuit this is five in a blue for an instant and rare and has convoke and it
2:01:12
says you may cast sorcery spells this turn as though they had Flash
2:01:18
and when you cast your next next instant or sorcery spell this turn copy that spell twice you may choose new targets
2:01:26
for the copies I'm just like never I mean I might do
2:01:32
this twice stream it does come it might say you're actually getting paid for this like I'm not saying this card's
2:01:38
good but you are getting paid you are what I mean is it just a removal spell
2:01:45
like that you're trying to to Triple up on here or whatever I mean if you could
2:01:50
triple up on the like incubate equal the number of lands you control that could be pretty good
2:01:56
but I'm paying a six Mana instant yes with convoke but you know generally it's
2:02:02
difficult to get these things down to like one or zero Mana yeah
2:02:07
I'm not saying you should complete the circuit but in your like turbo convoke that because remember convoke is red
2:02:13
blue primarily in your convoke deck where you have all these tokens and you can play this for like three mana and
2:02:20
top three creatures and then spend three Mana to play a spell and get three copies you are getting three total spells out of the deal like
2:02:27
imagine if you had how many one Mana you know decent spells would you need before
2:02:33
this uh this became something you were interested in like like three or four or
2:02:39
something so like
2:02:44
yeah I'm just I'm trying to look at like some of the cheap spells I mean there's
2:02:49
like this book costs two lessons if it targets an attacking creature but are they really gonna have three attacking
2:02:55
creatures yeah I mean ludicrous there's Red Burn spells
2:03:01
that that could maybe get you there but yes okay this is this is a bit tough I I will say that a bit tough I'm gonna give
2:03:07
it an F
2:03:14
all right let's move on to our gold cards this is where they really unleash the the fury usually so let's see if
2:03:21
they do here our first one up is called invasion of new forexia and it is a
2:03:27
Mythic rare battle with six defense and it is blue white X to cast it when it
2:03:35
enters a battlefield you create x 2 2 white and blue Knight creature tokens
2:03:41
with vigilance so that's excellent right very very good think
2:03:48
like five Mana right you get three two two vigilance and also those are creatures that you
2:03:54
can use of course to help transform this into teferi acosa oh yeah I didn't know he had a last name of zelfir this is a
2:04:01
planeswalker legendary Planeswalker to Ferry at for loyalty three abilities plus one draw two cards then discard two
2:04:09
cards unless you discard a creature card minus two you get an emblem with knights you control get plus one plus zero and
2:04:15
have Ward one and minus three which notably you can do right away tap X creatures you control
2:04:22
when you do Shuffle Target non-land permanent and opponent controls with Mana value X or less into its owner's
2:04:28
Library so you get a decent Planeswalker like that isn't you know this isn't the type
2:04:34
of Planeswalker that you're like oh the game's just over but it is pretty good it's very good yeah
2:04:41
I would I would say that makes x22 knights with a vigilance is
2:04:48
like an A minus yeah I think so too because like look four Mana for Two Fine deal that's the buyout right that's
2:04:54
where you're like if I'm in desperate Dire Straits I cast this turn four I have let's say a slow hand with two five
2:05:00
drops turn four I'm making two nights right a lot of stats four four with the stats for four mana and then the more
2:05:06
you can slow roll this to just cast it for eight mana and make six tokens the better and all of a sudden you're you're
2:05:11
really talking you are and then you also have that easy easier math where you can
2:05:17
because again what part of the big cost of trying to flip over these battles is leaving your defenses down for a turn
2:05:22
and since these have vigilance you can say well would I be okay with losing two of these Knights to get to Ferry and
2:05:28
it's like probably you go attack all of them at my battle and then you go okay block these two and then the rest get
2:05:33
through and boom also they have vigilance so you're not overextending that that's what I was saying yeah you
2:05:39
take away that defensive live ability part of the equation yeah and then I think a lot of the times
2:05:45
you're actually just gonna immediately minus two to make all your Knights into three twos with a board one so I was
2:05:50
thinking too yeah and I was thinking it like slightly first noted
2:05:56
um I like a for invasion of neufrexia yeah I think it's a pretty easy eh uh
2:06:03
what is errant and Giada do one blue white for a 2-3 legendary human Angel at
2:06:08
rare Flash and flying you can look at the top cardio Library any time and you can cast spells with flash or flying
2:06:15
from the top of your library so I would give a b to a three Mana two three flash flyer because that's actually we're
2:06:21
talking actual ambushing at that point that is two for one territory right and then getting uh the ability to just cast
2:06:29
you know some some freeze free Flyers mostly there's not that many flash cards in general
2:06:35
I would say it's probably a B plus and in the right deck it's closer to an A minus like if you can Flash this out end
2:06:40
of turn and remember to look if you flash it into turn look at your upkeep you might have a flash creature there uh
2:06:45
yeah and then get there you can get some you can get some pretty good stuff out of that yeah I like that b plus for
2:06:51
errant and Giada uh here's our preview card hiditsugu and Kyrie this is two blue blue black for a
2:06:59
5-4 flying legendary creature ogre demon dragon at rare when it enters the battlefield draw three cards then put
2:07:05
two cards from your hand on top of your library in any order AKA brainstorm and then this is a crazy part when it dies
2:07:11
Exile the top card of your library Target opponent loses life equal to its Mana value if it's an instant or sorcery
2:07:18
card you may cast it without paying its Mana cost you can play some serious mind games with that right so when you cast
2:07:25
this your opponent's gonna assume that the top card of your deck after you resolve the brainstorm ability the first one is gonna be an instant or sorcery so
2:07:32
they're like okay I'm not going to kill it right away but if you think they think that then you can put it second you draw your card attack and then they
2:07:39
kill it then all of a sudden it goes nuts there and uh you know so on and so forth obviously
2:07:45
you only have the choice between those top two but but it's from your whole hand and the three cards that you got so
2:07:52
you may just have two of them in it for a 5-4 flying that better than
2:07:58
draws a card but still effectively draws you one card right you're plus one and when it dies they take some damage and
2:08:04
maybe you get to cast a free spell like maybe you get free mana and another card I mean this is an a like this card's
2:08:10
fantastic absolutely so a for hittitugo and Kyrie next is rankle and tour brand
2:08:15
this is one black black red red so five Mana for a three four legendary fairy
2:08:21
dwarf what happened there uh
2:08:27
wrinkle master that tour brand that the stupid dork yeah gotcha it's those two okay and they
2:08:34
combine for a 3-4 flying First Strike haste and whenever wrinkle and torbrand Deals
2:08:41
combat damage to a player or battle choose any number you can have each player create a treasure token each
2:08:48
player sacrifice the creature and or if a source would deal damage to a player or battle this turn it deals that much
2:08:54
damage plus two instead I don't get that part
2:09:02
um it basically makes it so if you're about to play this and then attack a battle you can you get uh
2:09:10
you'll get extra damage on that battle but it says whenever this deals combat damage to a player that's when you
2:09:15
choose it player or battle so how do you
2:09:22
think so so your other creatures are attacking right your other creature attacking the battle this is them gotcha
2:09:30
well let's talk about the Mana cost right because this is probably the biggest sticking point all the text is
2:09:36
great um and for and I would definitely pay five Mana for this card but can is it
2:09:43
five Mana one black black red red I think in a black red deck let's say you're nine eight in black red deck
2:09:49
right or let's say you're eight let's say you're nine nine because you have eight a one bloodfoul caves eight swamps
2:09:55
eight mountains on five Mana are you gonna cast this card most of the time when you have five
2:10:00
lands in play you're more likely to cast it than not cast it but you're not always gonna cast it and sometimes
2:10:06
you're really gonna get screwed and you're gonna draw four swamps but obviously that's going to be pretty bad for you no matter what
2:10:12
I would say that the Mana cost is not nothing but it's not crazy bad
2:10:18
double is just I mean double double is not is not impact it's a lot easier than triple I think but we have to ding it a
2:10:25
little bit for it right yeah I do all right I'm fine with a
2:10:33
minus the other thing is making a treasure token is not that good because right basically first crack at it right
2:10:39
each player Stacks a creature can be really good depending on what you've set up but is not the easiest and then the
2:10:46
the whole battle thing seems quite unlikely to to Really pan out yeah
2:10:52
so it's it's more about player but yeah a minus for wrinkle and tour brand and unlikely uh Duo next is kogla and idaro
2:11:00
all right now these I see I can see these two hanging out this is two green green uh red red for a seven seven
2:11:07
legendary ape Dinosaur turtle not the rails at rare when it enters the
2:11:13
battlefield choose one against trample and haste until end of turn uh or it fights Target creature you don't control
2:11:20
wow that's actually possibly be a fair fight kogla and yadar or just like it's
2:11:25
like dinosaurs and this is like what's it called right this is like
2:11:31
I can't remember if they did this but is this like Dylan King Kong and Godzilla fighting okay I'm sure I'm sure they
2:11:36
teamed up at some point I'm not a King Kong Lore Master to be honest but either but and then this also has another so by
2:11:43
the way those are two fantastic abilities right one of them fighting either kills basically anything in the
2:11:49
other one just says okay I could slam right away if it's gonna win me the game but it also has two green red discard
2:11:55
kogla and yodaro what does that mean so from your hand
2:12:01
you can pay four mana and discard it okay and then destroy an artifactor enchantment and then Shuffle this into
2:12:07
your deck and draw a card destroy up to one target artifice so you can just do this
2:12:12
if you're stuck on Mana you can pay for put this back in your deck and draw a card
2:12:17
that's the yardaro ability remember it jumps out of your deck if you cycled it a bunch of times right I mean these cards in a plus wait it's a six Mana
2:12:24
seven seven that fights one of their creatures or kills them or or attacks them for seven right
2:12:31
in the situations where that's lethal you just do that it's not a believable car that's just an unbelievable card and
2:12:37
that's a regular rare again the only caveat is that it is double Red Double green so you gotta you know factor that
2:12:43
in a little bit but as Luis described that's not like a deal breaker it's just a little harder a plus for coglin yadaro
2:12:49
uh we've got galta and maverin so this is galta the the Tyrannosaurus Rex and
2:12:54
then mavern the vampire okay it's three green green white white for a 12 12
2:13:00
legendary creature dinosaur vampire seven Mana 12 12 trample whenever you attack
2:13:07
and this is by the way whenever you attack so you can cast this an attack with something and
2:13:13
choose to do that right away okay whenever you attack choose one create a tapped and attacking
2:13:19
XX green dinosaur token with trample where X is the greatest power among other attacking creatures so it doesn't
2:13:25
count itself for that or create x118 vampire tokens with Life Link where X is the number of other attacking creatures
2:13:32
that's this these these designs are really cool yeah they're they're really funny so
2:13:40
[Music] tramples obviously just like so big that
2:13:46
it could have been a 10 10 or 8 8 or whatever but you know the stats do matter sometimes but more importantly
2:13:51
you play this immediately attack and make like a 3-3 dinosaur or
2:13:58
if you attack with multiple creatures maybe two or three one one life links like the two or three one on life things
2:14:03
really excite me because you get to play this in attack with three creatures and gain three life just right off the bat
2:14:11
well are they attacking or no oh wow weird so you just sit back yeah
2:14:18
the dinosaur creature took an attacks yes the vampires do not no so it's kind
2:14:23
of like a defense offense thing it's like well well that's all that's
2:14:29
arguably better yeah because now you yeah you get to make the vampires if
2:14:34
you're gonna die make the or if you have a lot of attackers and make the dinosaur if it's attacking weird Okay exactly
2:14:41
um probably give this an a honestly yeah I mean the seven Mana is a little
2:14:46
tougher right so it might be trending certainly a minus but come on 12 12 with
2:14:51
trample like just that is going to end the game if it doesn't get killed and this does a lot
2:14:58
more than that yeah I would just go a on galta and mount Maverick I don't think you can cast it
2:15:04
you're just gonna win especially because it does matter the turn that you cast it you get the ability uh drana and linvala
2:15:12
this is one white white black for a legendary vampire angel It's a 3-4 at
2:15:18
regular rare it has flying and vigilance so four Mana three four flying vigilance already pretty good activated abilities
2:15:24
of creatures your opponent's control can't be activated wow and that doesn't uh mention anything about Mana abilities
2:15:32
right so it just shuts them all down oh yeah just like they're just like uh yeah
2:15:37
yeah and then drana and linvala has all activated abilities of All Creatures
2:15:42
your opponents control you may spend Mana as though they were Mana abilities of any color to activate those abilities
2:15:50
that gets weird yeah that's bizarre so it turns off all
2:15:55
their abilities and steals them yes yeah and you get a four Mana three four
2:16:01
flying vigilance just as your base I seems really solid I mean I I would
2:16:06
probably go like more B plus range for drana I think b-plus because it's also the
2:16:12
like the Mana cost on Galton maverin the double green double white doesn't matter that much because by the time you hit
2:16:18
seven in a green white deck probably cast it Jordan then vola costing white white black and in one so four Mana this
2:16:26
on turn four will sometimes Miss yes and that's and that that is a little bit
2:16:31
more of a risk so yeah I like B plus on drawn and limbala yeah next is invasion
2:16:36
of tolvata which is three black white for a five defense battle it says when
2:16:41
it enters a battlefield return Target non-battle permanent card from your graveyard to the battlefield
2:16:48
okay so you you know regrow some non-battle card if you can get it transformed it becomes the broken Sky
2:16:55
which is an enchantment that says creature tokens you control get plus one plus zero and have LifeLink and it says
2:17:02
at the beginning of your end step create a 1-1 white and black Spirit creature token with flying and of course
2:17:09
basically you get a 2-1 flying LifeLink boy flipping this thing really pays you
2:17:16
off but it does seem difficult to do
2:17:26
and you know you need to be able to get back a you know a non-battle permanent
2:17:32
card I mean basically it says you get back a creature for five Mana five Mana for a zombified with
2:17:37
significant upside like this is one of those battles should win the game yes this and it pays you off the way you
2:17:43
want to be paid off it gives you that life Linker on your end step right at the beginning of your end step so you
2:17:50
flip this battle you get the life Linker it can block it means that you probably won't die and then you have this inevitability I actually like this a lot
2:17:57
because zombifies need a little bit of a bump and this one has a lot more than a little bit of a bump
2:18:02
so do you like this like a minus level or B plus I like it at B plus level it's
2:18:07
still conditional right it doesn't just do everything itself but the upside is you win the game so I like B plus for
2:18:14
invasion of tolvard I would play it in every deck that I thought could cast it yeah I like B plus for that all right uh
2:18:22
brawl and Carrie Zev is next this is one blue red for a too far legendary human
2:18:27
hey they're both humans um at rare it has first strike in Menace
2:18:33
and it says whenever you cast your first instant or sorcery spell each turn you
2:18:38
may cast a spell with lesser Mana value that shares a card type with it from your hand without paying its Mana cost
2:18:44
if you don't create first mate raghavan a legendary 2-1 red uh monkey pirate
2:18:52
creature token that gains haste until an intern and doesn't go away yes it is legendary but it doesn't
2:19:00
despair end of turn so you're not gonna use this to make it to make a free spell
2:19:06
that often that's I guess the curries of expertise kind of joke yeah very difficult to set that up but three Mana
2:19:12
two four First Strike Menace is already quite the brawler and then the first time you play an Instagram
2:19:17
story you get you get a little ragavon that sounds pretty good to me I like that and it it asks almost nothing of
2:19:22
you also adding First Strike to this card really does change it right because a 2-4 Menace can be double blocked
2:19:29
pretty effectively but a 2-4 First Strike Menace can't like no it's quite
2:19:34
different anything with two toughness that's in the equation just Gets Zapped and then the four toughness should be able to soak up the rest so really solid
2:19:41
card here also just the fact that you literally get a token that's called first mate raghavan a legendary 2-1 Red
2:19:48
Monkey pirate creature token is like unreal um I like B plus again for barol and Carrie
2:19:55
Zev yeah I would actually probably go almost to a minus like could see does your
2:20:01
opponent plays this on turn three it's gonna dominate the board for a while and then they're gonna get a free two one and if the two one ever trades off you
2:20:07
then get to make another two one try to do it again and sometimes you might even double spell it's not it's not
2:20:12
unrealistic to think that that could happen yeah and if you're being aggressive as well the 2-1 Haste The
2:20:18
haste aspect comes in yeah B plus a minus for brawl and Carries up seems really good next is glissa Herald of
2:20:25
predation oh this is all by herself this is three black green for a three five
2:20:30
legendary forexian zombie elf at rare at the beginning of combat on your turn
2:20:36
choose one incubate two twice or transform all incubator tokens you
2:20:44
control or forexen's U control gain first strike and death touch until end of turn wow
2:20:50
it's like they've laid it out in order you're like play this incubate you twice next turn transform all my incubators
2:20:56
next turn first strike and death touch love it it's like did you wonder how to use this card here's your recipe look
2:21:02
it's in this order dude you just gotta do it instruction book it's included another a you spend five Mana you get a
2:21:08
three five and you immediately incubate two twice they kill glissa and you're okay with it it's fine
2:21:13
you're just like play this all my frexians get first strike and death to attack you with three fractions or
2:21:19
whatever totally it's got five toughness so even if they have instant speed removal it also has to be removal that
2:21:25
can kill a Burly creature I like I like I think I just like a for a glissa Herald of predation
2:21:32
too much uh too much action all right what about yargoal and multani what did
2:21:38
they come up with together so this is three black black green for a frog Spirit Elemental it's a legendary
2:21:45
creature and it's an 1806. and that's that's what it is it's an eighteen six
2:21:53
a bunch of flavor text yep okay so this is an interesting
2:22:00
question right like how much Mana are we willing to pay for an 18-6
2:22:05
I mean look is this how much better is this than a colossal dreadmost six six trample well it's quite a bit better I
2:22:11
think it might be worse no it's better 186 is just so much bigger
2:22:18
like they can't double block it with two four fours you know where the Colossal dreadlock it's double true I just always
2:22:24
think of like they can't chump true but you know if you can give this
2:22:29
flying or trample with some ability that could always be really good well there's the backup red creature that lets you
2:22:34
sack it to deal 19. they're still straight 20 actually to your opponent yeah there's your dream life link on it
2:22:41
trample okay so it's a little better than a dread Ma this one's a little harder to
2:22:46
cast at three black black green I mean I think this is like a c like I
2:22:53
feel like it's ABC minus D Maybe it's not great yeah
2:23:00
C minus for Yargo and multani uh we'll have to see how it plays out next is jeru and hazaret this is two red red
2:23:06
white for a 5'4 legendary human got it rare as long as you have one or fewer
2:23:13
cards in hand it gets vigilance and haste and whenever it attacks look at
2:23:19
the top six cards of your library you may Exile a legendary creature card from
2:23:24
among them put the rest on the bottom in a random order until end of turn you may cast the exiled card without paying its
2:23:31
Mana cost dang you know there's a lot of Legends here at the rare slot I you know this it
2:23:38
doesn't seem super pushed to be a legend set but I mean every card we've read out of these Golds has all been Legends
2:23:44
right it's out outside of the battles so maybe it hits more often than you'd
2:23:50
think and obviously you don't need to sweeten the pot too much on a two red red white five four potential vigilance
2:23:56
haste yeah I mean it could easily have uh vigilance and haste to turn you plastic
2:24:02
if you curve into it and just boom and you don't need like it looks at six
2:24:09
cards so you don't need that many more cards uh or Legends to to hit maybe once
2:24:15
a game or something like that because it's probably gonna get two attacks in would you play this um without any Legends in your deck is the first
2:24:21
question the answer is sure right yeah if you have an aggressive deck you would yeah because you you would just play
2:24:26
this as your like second to last card or last card and just you know attach it immediately and it's okay at that you
2:24:33
know I would give it like a c plus mostly what it does yeah yeah and then occasionally you might hit something
2:24:39
else I I think I would go C plus for Jero and
2:24:44
hazaret and then if you do have one or two legendary creatures it gets up into the B range where you might be able to
2:24:50
hit I mean you get to play them without playing they're paying their Mana cost like it is an insane hit if you hit it
2:24:56
oh yeah so yeah C plus up into B if you can
2:25:02
build if you if you've got a couple Legends yeah yeah next is quintorius Lore Master
2:25:07
boy controllers missed so hard last time I hope that they beefed him here this is he's got the spark or whatever here oh
2:25:13
he is he's on fire this is three uh red white for a 3-5 legendary
2:25:19
elephant cleric at rare with vigilance I like the three five for elephant by the way that's that's the classic at the
2:25:26
beginning of your end step Exile Target non-creature non-land card from your graveyard and you get a 3-2 red and
2:25:33
white Spirit creature token all right so they made it easier and then it you can pay one white red and tap it plus
2:25:40
sacrifice a spirit to choose Target card exiled with quintorius you may cast that
2:25:46
card this spell without paying its Mana cost if that spell would be put into a graveyard put it on the bottom of its
2:25:52
owner's Library instead pretty neat that's really cool
2:25:58
so you get the three two you can turn it into the thing that you exiled yeah so you get the three two you pay five man I
2:26:05
think to play this immediately on your own step you Exile something get a three two and then next turn you can sack the
2:26:10
3-2 to play that card for free if it was a good card and and the only real catch
2:26:16
to all of this is that the card needs to be a non-creature non-land card that you're exiling so artifacts enchantments
2:26:24
instant sorceries Planeswalkers battles but creatures and lands are your most
2:26:30
common permanence in your limited deck so it is a it does cramp your style a little bit
2:26:36
but I mean even if you just use like some random combat trick and you get to Exile it and turn it into a 3-2 you're
2:26:42
already pretty happy yeah so I like b b plus for a quintorius
2:26:48
slower Master like you're getting a good amount of power and toughness you're you're getting the ability to just for
2:26:55
no extra Mana start making three twos and then I don't know about the activated ability as much but who cares
2:27:02
yeah I mean this takes a little work you're not going to have spells in your graveyard unless you build your deck
2:27:08
such that by turn five you'll have one or two spells in your graveyard but once you get to that point then I think
2:27:14
you'll be pretty happy so I I think Contours is like a B plus yeah that's what I think too uh what does Inga and
2:27:20
asika do it's two green blue for a 4-4 legendary creature human God at rare
2:27:26
creatures you control have vigilance and tap at one man of any color but spend
2:27:31
only on this Mana only to cast creatures whenever you cast a creature spell if three or more Mana from creatures were
2:27:37
spent to cast it draw a card kind of funny in the convoke Set uh
2:27:44
because it kind of gives your creatures this like weird convoke-ish ability yeah that's interesting
2:27:50
four four at the base yeah and uh it does make it so all your
2:27:57
creatures can can Now cast your other creatures and then if you start going
2:28:02
nuts with this then you end up in a spot where uh you get to draw a card whenever
2:28:07
you cast a creature as well how much value do you put on just getting vigilance to your other creatures no
2:28:14
no doesn't mean you can like attack and then develop your board right so that's not terrible
2:28:19
it feels like there's enough here to get Inga and asika up to a b but it's close like I would be leaning towards B minus
2:28:27
well I would probably lean towards B plus you in in a really creature heavy deck this this card I think is is quite
2:28:33
strong that is true you could just dump your whole hand the next turn it's a bit of a build around like it's not okay not
2:28:40
exactly a build around but I think it's a it's a bit of a build around um okay
2:28:46
so being trending towards B plus for Inga and asika in their Chariot next is cruxa and konoros which is three red
2:28:54
white black so we have uh I think there's is there a full cycle here
2:29:00
uh a little confused but whatever there's uh some of these are are triple
2:29:05
colored cards and this is one of them uh and so this one is a legendary Elder
2:29:10
giant dog and it is a Mythic rare it's a six six vigilance Menace LifeLink
2:29:18
that's insane um and it says whenever it enters a battlefield or attacks you may Exile
2:29:24
five cards from your graveyard when you do return Target creature card from your
2:29:30
graveyard to the battlefield so you have to Exile five cards and then if there's a creature card left over you
2:29:36
can get it back which doesn't make sense to me because kunuros stopped creatures from coming back so that was like a
2:29:42
little weird but I mean who knows uh so six Mana six six vigilance Menace
2:29:49
LifeLink sure I'm just in for that it's three color card it's not the easiest to cast but still in and then
2:29:55
in the late game this starts bringing creatures back yeah I mean this isn't a minus just respect the Mana cost I mean
2:30:01
there's there's all these lands I don't anticipate it'll be that hard I think respect the Mana cost but you're getting six six LifeLink that's really key next
2:30:09
is borborygmos and fibble thip man I the meetings for these cards must
2:30:15
have just been nonsense um borberg most and fibblefib hat it cost two green blue red for a 6'5
2:30:23
legendary Cyclops homunculus at Mythic and when it enters the battlefield or attacks draw a card then you may discard
2:30:31
any number of land cards when you discard one or more cards this way
2:30:37
uh it deals this card deals twice that much damage to Target creature
2:30:42
uh it also has the activated ability one in a blue put borborygmos and fibblefib
2:30:48
into its owner's Library third from the top so can still run away and hide
2:30:55
so so first off it's five Mana for a six five that when
2:31:01
you attack draws you a card or enters the battlefield or enters the battlefield draws you a card yeah and
2:31:08
you don't have the discard you can just straight up right I was sending the sentence there to show that like that's
2:31:14
great right and then you can discard as many lands as you want to deal two damage per
2:31:20
land to a creature do one for a shock do another for four damage to a creature
2:31:26
yeah and then if you really need to you can tuck it in your library third from the
2:31:33
top which is kind of a long way off but then you draw it you at etbs you get to draw the card again
2:31:40
I mean I it's weird but like how what's not to like here right no it's a good
2:31:46
card yeah it's just amazing it protects you from flood by you know you if you have this card in your deck really try
2:31:51
to hold lands if you can because you'll want to play this and immediately nug something just turning your lands into shocks is really nice Definitely also
2:31:59
it's just splashable or easy we're splashing because you just play this and you draw a card immediately and then if they don't kill it you attack and draw a
2:32:05
card and if you have enough Mana like late in the game you can play this with two men up and then it's it's protects
2:32:11
itself yeah I would probably give it this an A minus
2:32:17
two yeah I mean it's a two for one the Turn You cast it it's huge and it protects itself and can manage the board
2:32:24
if left unchecked or even right away a minus for board group most and fibble the card's just awesome really Thalia
2:32:31
and the gitrog monster man what happened on this plane uh this is one black one
2:32:37
black white green well it's not one plane it's just all of them right the frexians are invading all of them at once they yeah they did the classic
2:32:43
battle strategy of having as many fronts as possible yeah and that's worked out really well every single plane and all
2:32:48
these disparate allies are teaming up to battle back at the greatest threat known to you not even Humanity just to Life as
2:32:54
we know it okay so that's what's happening is that Thalia and the get rug monster were like all right well we're gonna lose it all so one white black
2:33:02
green for a 4-4 First Strike death touch it's a legendary human frog horror at
2:33:08
Mythic and I mean first strike and death touch are just you know peanut butter and jelly man that's like one of the
2:33:13
best two combos uh two uh keyword combos you can get it says you may play an
2:33:19
additional land on each of your turns which is okay at the four Mana slot you might actually get a land drop out of
2:33:25
that but not great creature and non-basic lands your opponent's control enter the battlefield tap so there's
2:33:31
thalia's addition to the party and whenever Thalia and the get rock monster attacks sacrifice the creature or land
2:33:38
then draw a card not optional by the way right right I mean if this didn't cost three
2:33:45
different colors it would be an easy a yes I still think it's an a because if you play this
2:33:50
unkillable in combat I guess if they block with five four fours they can kill it uh it lets you play extra lands which
2:33:57
works nicely with the last ability because you're sacking your lands and drawing cards so you get to like get keep keep hitting land drops and then it
2:34:04
makes all your opponents creatures enter the battlefield tapped that's pretty substantial ability so I'd give an a
2:34:09
toll in the get rock monster its abilities are keyed a little more towards the early part of the game
2:34:14
so try to have good Mana so you can cast it but it's just a fantastic card if you can yeah I agree it does the I mean the
2:34:21
only irony to it is that it's not like the creatures could have interacted with it in combat anyway so
2:34:27
that their tap probably doesn't really matter uh zirgo and ojitai is next this
2:34:32
is two blue red white for a 4-4 legendary orc Dragon at Mythic with
2:34:39
flying in haste so we got a five Mana four four flying haste that has hex proof as long as it entered the
2:34:44
battlefield this turn and there's no window there right no it just has it just has it whenever one or
2:34:51
more dragons you control deal combat damage to a player or battle look at the
2:34:57
top three cards of your library put one of them into your hand and the rest on the bottom of your library in any order
2:35:03
you may return one of those dragons to its owner's hand
2:35:09
top three so I don't get it you play this it has
2:35:16
hasten hex proof you hit them you get to you get to impulse yes and then if you want you can return this
2:35:23
to your hand you may return oh one of those dragons that attacked that technically this this
2:35:29
also uh yeah keys off other dragons hitting but that's not super relevant for our purposes the reason to do this
2:35:35
is you keep it permanent hex proof it's proofed up look when you play this on turn five you're
2:35:41
not bouncing it that's just not going to be a player gonna make when you play this on turn 10 and both players are not
2:35:47
doing anything yeah you you probably want to do that because there's no window for them to use a removal spell on it then it comes at a cost of five
2:35:54
Mana a turn but if your opponent isn't attacking you and doesn't have the ability to mess with it then you would
2:35:59
do that yeah so I mean five Mana four four flying Haze text proof and then draw a card when it
2:36:06
hits them or hits one of the battles yeah that's that's great that's probably an A minus for Zerg that's what I think too and it
2:36:14
is also a battle flipper very nice uh next is Simone and Dina this is
2:36:20
oh my favorite color Trio this is black green blue for a three four legendary human dryad at Mythic whenever you draw
2:36:27
so three Mana three four nice whenever you draw your second card each turn Target opponent loses to life and you
2:36:33
gain two life and you can tap it and sacrifice another creature to draw a card you may put a land card from your
2:36:40
hand onto the battlefield tapped if you control eight or more lands repeat this process once
2:36:46
the process being drawing another card and then putting a land into play okay
2:36:51
and then once you activate this ability of course you're draining uh your opponent for two assuming you do it on
2:36:56
your turn right because that would be your second card if you have seven lands in play on their turn you can activate
2:37:01
this put a line into play Draw another card and yeah it'll trigger then too if you wanted to Chomp first
2:37:07
I like this card it takes a little bit of build around work because three colors and you want to sack other
2:37:13
creatures but splashing this in a deck that has a bunch of good creatures like a green black deck or something sounds
2:37:19
great to me because the ability is really good caching in a creature for a card and two life and then eventually
2:37:25
two cards because once you get up to eight lands it's perfect so I would give Simone and Dina a B plus okay I like
2:37:31
that too the Mana cost being again the the most difficult thing three colors in early is tough next is invasion of Alara
2:37:39
and if you thought that was a tough Mana cost this one's wuburg costs white blue black red green straight up it is a
2:37:45
battle it has seven defense it says when it enters a battlefield Exile cards from the top of your library until you Exile
2:37:52
two non-land cards with Mana value four or less you may cast one of those cards
2:37:57
with one of those two cards without paying its Mana cost put one of put one
2:38:02
of them in your hand then put the other cards exiled this way on the bottom of your library in a random order
2:38:09
I'll just read it so if you can transform it it's awaken the Maelstrom it's a sorcery it's all colors uh Target
2:38:15
player draws two cards you may put an artifact card from your hand onto the battlefield create a token that's a copy of the of a permanent you control
2:38:22
distribute three plus and plus one counters among one two or three creatures you control destroy Target permanent opponent controls I mean this
2:38:29
is all fun and games and stuff but I mean come on right we're just not casting invasion normally yes but there are all those top
2:38:36
plans I could see Dex playing this because it does double Cascade basically Cascades two but you get to play one for
2:38:44
free and put the other in your hand and then once you flip this seven defenses a lot you get this blow up their best
2:38:50
thing you draw two cards you copy your best thing whatever this is a build around a in a five color
2:38:57
deck this is very much worth building towards not everyone's going to play it and we have seen that in in decks in in
2:39:03
formats that have good fixing yeah so I like build around a for invasion of Alara uh we have another
2:39:09
five killer card here ish it's omnath locus of all it keeps adding colors so he's
2:39:15
blue white red green plus frexian black so one of each color wuburg except the
2:39:22
black you can pay with two life so you don't have to pay all five legendary creature frecks in Elemental four four
2:39:28
if you'd lose unspent Mana that Amanda becomes black instead so your Mana just starts building up the omnath dies uh
2:39:36
you that and that Mana goes away because he has to be in play for that to happen and then at the beginning of your
2:39:41
pre-combat main phase look at the top cardier Library you may reveal that card if it has three or more colored Mana
2:39:46
symbols in its Mana cost if you do add three Mana any combination of its colors and put it in your hand if you don't
2:39:52
reveal it put it in your hand so basically this draws you a card of return and if you run into a spell that
2:39:58
has three different three total Mana colored Mana symbols whether they're the same or different you can reveal it to add three Mana but
2:40:05
you're probably not going to do that very much but mostly it's a five color four four
2:40:11
that draws a card every turn really A four color because you can always pay the two life yeah this one I like a lot less because you're putting
2:40:18
in a bunch of work and you're getting a 4 4 that draws you a card at return right which is good but man you're just
2:40:24
not gonna have like the like age of five colors it'd be close to an A but it doesn't it costs very much very very
2:40:30
different amount of cost so I would give omnath a build around C if you if the Mana works you can play it
2:40:36
and it's going to be good it's not worth stretching like if you're a blue white deck trying to stretch red or green Mana
2:40:43
into your deck to cast this not so much all right that brings us go ahead I was
2:40:48
gonna say realm breaker The Invasion tree is next there's an artifact it's a legendary artifact at rare
2:40:54
two-tap Target opponent Mills three cards put a land card from their graveyard onto the battlefield tapped under your control it gains if uh if
2:41:02
this land would leave the battlefield Exile instead of putting it anywhere else and then 10 tap sacrifice realm breaker
2:41:09
search your library for any number of preature cards and put them on the battlefield and Shuffle it also costs
2:41:15
three to cast it yeah I I'm not I'm not interested in this card it's just this is enough it's just
2:41:21
too much nonsense can I can we use it to Mill them out if you're a mill deck yes it does Mill
2:41:27
them through a turn but I don't think that's historically a very good strategy how about sword of Once and Future so
2:41:34
this is I think the last one of the sword cycle it's three Mana for an artifact equipment uh a quick creature
2:41:40
has plus two plus two and pro blue and pro black when a creature deals combat damage
2:41:46
to a player surveilled to then you may cast an instant or sorcery spell with Mana value two or less from your
2:41:51
graveyard without paying its Mana cost and then you Exile it if you do that and it is equipped too and it's so thick
2:41:57
three Mana equipped two give a creature plus two plus two pro blue and black and then when it hits them you get to
2:42:03
surveil two and maybe play a spell for free out of your graveyard obviously that combos you can choose to surveil a spell in your graveyard and play it
2:42:09
right away these these words are all pretty good and this one I think is no exception like you run into a deck with
2:42:14
these colors even one of the two colors you're pretty happy and every time you hit them you get a pretty decent Advantage so I would give an A minus to
2:42:21
sword and once in future I would too just plus two plus two already transforms any of your creatures into a
2:42:27
threat and the extra bonus is nice they've done a much better job of balancing these you know the initial swords were just like ludicrously busted
2:42:33
these are just merely awesome our last colorless card is invasion of Ravnica
2:42:39
which is five Mana for a battle with four defense and it says when it enters
2:42:44
a battlefield Exile Target non-land permanent and opponent controls that isn't exactly two colors what does that
2:42:52
mean it doesn't Exile Guild permanence because it's invasion of Ravnica oh gotcha so it can't Exile any of the team
2:43:00
ups like it can't Exile called yodaro because they're two they're red two colors but it's writing is just funny
2:43:05
because in English when we say isn't exactly that yeah very weird it's weird
2:43:11
that's the front side what does the back side do so yeah so if you get the four defense it becomes Guild packed Paragon
2:43:17
which is a 5-5 artifact creature construct it says whenever you cast a spell that's exactly two colors look at
2:43:24
the top six cards of your library you may reveal a card that's exactly two colors from among them and put it into
2:43:30
your hand put the rest on the bottom so it searches up guild based things
2:43:37
I mean I I'd pay five Mana for a sorcery speed removal that left behind
2:43:42
a a five five that you took some work to get to even if you had no exactly two
2:43:47
color spells
2:43:53
it's pretty solid it is annoying that it can't kill a lot of the best cards in the set yeah a lot of the rare bombs
2:44:00
gonna come up you know yeah for sure yeah you know glissa out and you're just
2:44:05
like okay yeah I have my five Mana removal spell that doesn't actually kill it still I do like it at B I mean we're
2:44:11
still talking about a good two for one opportunity if you can get the thing transformed it can kind of run away okay so Luis there's another sheet of
2:44:19
Multiverse Legends cards yeah and these will appear in the in the draft packs
2:44:26
similar to how we've seen these extra bonus sheets where there's one slot for them there's uncommon rare and Mythic
2:44:32
rare cards that can be in that slot so you don't know which one you're gonna get on any given time
2:44:39
um but these are all reprints so we're gonna go over these but I think we should be pretty brisk with them because
2:44:44
these cards have all been printed and and focus a little bit more on the like how good is this one where does this
2:44:50
lead you does does that make sense to you yeah uh so I think that what we're going
2:44:56
to want to do is do uh like a kind of small bonus episode where we just Hammer all these out at once oh okay okay and
2:45:03
and and and and so we've got the rare Mythic review and certainly before next week I think probably later this week
2:45:08
we'll we'll get the bonus episode out does that sound good yeah that makes sense to me because these are only one
2:45:13
slot but they will they do it's weird because they do affect the the draft
2:45:18
format so we do have to go over them but they're also reprints and only one slot so they're not quite the same as as the
2:45:25
there's some regular interesting cards to talk about for sure though okay so we'll so we'll definitely get to those we will address those uh on the next
2:45:31
episode of the show whether that's later this week or early next uh but we will do so so that's gonna do it for the rare
2:45:38
and Mythic Revere rare show here for March of the machine uh once again we want to thank all of our uh supporters
2:45:44
on patreon for supporting the show it's patreon.com limited resources thank you thank you thank you to everybody over
2:45:50
there for keeping us going um if you want to find us on social media I'm Marshall underscore LR and Luis is lsv you can find everything
2:45:57
related to the podcast over at lrcast.com and that's going to do it
2:46:03
we'll see you next week so I have a question for you Marshall I've been doing these Cube money drafts
2:46:09
you know we've got a Discord where uh where the degen's gather I I got to catch uh part of your one last night I'm
2:46:15
gonna watch the rest but uh these are my wheelhouse man I I'll watch as many of these as used three v3s with like highly
2:46:22
skilled players like last night it was uh myself uh Alpha frog so Gavin
2:46:27
Thompson he was in the MPL he's cute for the next PT and then uh one of his friends Mack against Luis salvato Eli
2:46:34
Cassis and uh Sandy dog so so the real LSD and uh you know I ended up
2:46:42
going 2-1 with a sick underworld breach that got kind of unlucky I think to not go 3-0 and but but my team ended up
2:46:50
losing so I have the question for you so far in the last set of drafts I've done uh I have gone two one two one two one
2:46:57
one two one two so I'm slightly ahead I'm I'm ahead one match win in terms of win rate right but I have lost three of
2:47:05
the five drafts I'm slightly down on drafts so am I winning in the drafts or losing in the drafts oh here's my record
2:47:11
is positive my team record's negative you're winning it's team draft right so sometimes you have to take one for the
2:47:16
team you draft a bit of a stinker but you keep the other guys off of it you take your lumps but as a team you win
2:47:22
yeah no you're winning for sure but I'm losing in drafts though wait I thought you were winning in
2:47:28
drafts no I I won two drafts and lost three drafts but my individual record is
2:47:33
positive no then it's the opposite you're losing I'm sorry well see I thought you were being carried you you used to work in 18 teams
2:47:39
corporate job I did you understand metrics and kpis that that's what we
2:47:44
tracked in my yeah yeah so let's just say I'm gonna choose for this one my kpi being my match wins which are positive
2:47:51
not my team wins which are negative it it is tricky but you I think it really
2:47:57
just depends on the situation now if these were reversed maybe I'd be tracking team wins but how convenient
2:48:04
for you just you know what it's sometimes tricky to figure out what to track and my advice to you whether it's at work or
2:48:10
otherwise try to figure out what your goal is and maybe track towards that goal note this
2:48:15
is not actually good advice to tracking things but it's good advice to make you look good which in some cases more
2:48:20
important
